A custom skin is a way to personalize the player model and can be done either by using a variety of community-made skin editors, or by editing the steve.png or alex.png file manually with an image editor like Photoshop, GIMP, Paint.net or similar image editors. The steve.png file can be downloaded here and the alex.png file here. When editing the steve.png or alex.png file manually, be sure to keep the original image dimensions and make the background of the skin (the unused pixels) completely transparent. Otherwise, Minecraft may fail to recognize the skin as intended.

In a bid to let players customize their characters' appearance and give them more control, Minecraft allows them to download a variety of skins. These cosmetics are essentially custom apparel and color schemes that players can download from the official Minecraft website.
Since Pocket Edition v0.11.0 alpha, players can choose one of the two default skins either Steve or Alex, and can apply their own custom skin. (Uses the same format as the Java edition). The player must select a valid skin image from their photo library, and must choose between the two main models. Players can also spend Minecraft Coins to buy skin packs. The Legacy Skin Pack was also implemented in Bedrock Edition, but the player has to sign in to Xbox Live to access all the skins. It also includes five anonymous skins. Players can also make their own skin packs, which must include a manifest.json file, a skins.json file, and all the desired skins. An additional .lang file can be added inside a folder labeled texts to display the skin names, but the game can register the skins without it.
After making a custom skin, either by using a skin editor or by editing the steve.png file directly, one still needs to upload the .png file at the Skin section of the Profile page on Minecraft.net (found here) before the skin is applied. Other players in multiplayer can also see this skin. Note that players cannot see the custom skin if they are not logged in or when playing offline.
Only players who have purchased Minecraft can change their character's skin. This is done on the profile page or in the Minecraft Launcher by uploading a valid .png texture that is 64×64 pixels, or a legacy texture that is 64×32 pixels, which then replaces the default skin.

Once they've created or selected their skin, they will need to get it onto their Windows 10 device. Every Minecraft skin website that lets users create or choose a skin should have the option to Download or Save that skin. When prompted to save the file, they can select Save.

Villager is a Novice which is the lowest level. Villagers that are spawned as "Novice" will not immediately select a profession and may even switch professions on you. If you want the villager to hold its profession, you must spawn them with at least a level of "Apprentice".
When the trader does appear, he only sticks around for about an hour before disappearing again, so you will want to be quick to see what special items they have available for trading. These items are not worth more as a rule, but they are rare which means they are absolutely worth getting hold of.
The problem with this trader is that working out where they will appear is a bit of a nonstarter. It appears at random with no indication of where or when it will show up, but you will know when you have found the right trader as there will be leashed trading llamas walking alongside it.
