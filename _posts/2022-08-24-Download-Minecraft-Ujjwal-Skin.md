Its a good app. I like the skins they have, multiple choices of how to download the skins, good designs, and lots of choices. One thing that is so annoying though, is the fact that I get an ad EVERY TIME I click ANYTHING!!! It's SO annoying. I feel that this app would be better by a TON, if you fixed the problem. Other than that, it's a pretty decent app.
