## Minecraft is a popular computer game that can be played on many platforms.

Turn Minecraft into a 2D side-scroller, and you have Terraria. This very successful title has released on pretty much every platform available since its initial launch in 2011. In many ways, Terraria mirrors the aspects that make Minecraft so appealing while still retaining its own character and charm. The goals here are much the same. Explore a vast, randomly-generated world, build a base, mine materials, and fight enemies. There’s more emphasis on combat in Terraria, and you’ll face bosses and recruit NPCs that can help further your abilities, which might be appealing to anyone who thinks Minecraft can be too directionless and lonely.

Minecraft is among the most popular topics on YouTube, having recieved over one trillion views.Notch's channel, which no longer has content, received over a million views, 33 million video views, and has 91,500+ subscribers. User-created tutorial and demonstration videos, "Let's Play" series, Machinimas, and various other videos are also common. Prior to Alpha v1.0.4, this read "700+ hits on YouTube!".
Minecraft isn’t based on voxels, but don’t count those awesome little things out. That’s what Terasology uses, as it was actually born from a Minecraft-esque tech demo. It’s a cheatable, modular game with tons of blocks to build with, creatures to explore, and survival as one of your most important goals. It’s a wide-open area rife with fun areas to check out with friends or solo, and it’s getting larger each day as developers continue working on it.
Minecraft is currently closed-source proprietary software, meaning the source code has not been publicly released. Before he sold the game to Microsoft, Notch mentioned this could change "once sales start dying and a minimum time has passed", at which point he would "possibly release it all as public domain".
This voxel-based RPG is all about exploration, and it takes place in a massive procedurally-generated world. You can opt for one of four different classes: Warrior, Ranger, Rogue, or Mage to jump in and start making the fantasy world yours. You can craft weapons and other gear, take on quests, assist residents of the world, and fight off massive scads of bloodthirsty monsters. Earn gold, collect magic artifacts, and even discover magical items to help you along the way. There’s a lot going on in CubeWorld, which makes it a very close Minecraft analogue.

Craving the quiet serenity of a game like Minecraft, but don’t want to actually play Minecraft? Or maybe you feel as though you’ve seen everything the game has to offer you for now and want to try something a little different. There are a ton of Minecraft-esque titles out there in the world, and some are truly excellent swaps.
Minecraft is playable with a keyboard. This splash text still appears in versions that do not contain keyboard support, such as Legacy Console Edition. This issue was fixed in the New Nintendo 3DS Edition only, as the splash text was replaced with “Touch Compatible!” Which, this version, indeed, is touch compatible.
At first glance, Unturned looks like another friendly take on Minecraft, but play for a while and you’ll realize how sinister things really are. You play a survivor of some gross, zombie-infested ruins after society has long been exterminated—mostly. You and a few other survivors must work together to try and rebuild, all the while trying to eliminate zombies and keep them away. They won’t make survival easy for you either. You have to collect fruits and vegetables, hunt animals, fish for food, tend crops, and create shelters so you’ve got somewhere to go when the weather turns nasty. Do all of this while zombies are breathing down your neck. Not so peaceful now, huh?
Infiniminer has a lot in common with Minecraft in terms of aesthetics, but its core components are a bit different. This first-person adventure is all about competitive mining and takes place in a procedurally-generated world of blocks that you can build with and explore. It’s a fairly old game, but it’s still very much an exciting game if you’re into games like Minecraft, as it offers many of the same thrills, with endearing graphics and plenty to do and see.
