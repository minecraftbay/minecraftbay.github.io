Similar to Java Edition, you can upload a skin you got from the internet, or one you've created yourself for your Bedrock character model. With tons of creative Minecraft users eager to share their skins, you can find almost any cosmetic you can dream up.
You are now ready to download and install skins in Minecraft. There are several rare ones from Avengers to Mario that you can try looking for. If you don’t find anything you like, you can always try making your own Minecraft skin. But don’t forget to share these skins you make with the readers in the comments below. You can also share them with the massive community on some of these amazing Discord servers for Minecraft. As for those looking for a new experience beyond the skins, try these best sandbox games like Minecraft. Now, go ahead and start installing new Minecraft skins.
You can use the Bedrock Edition tutorial earlier in this article to install new skins in the Pocket Edition of Minecraft. The major difference you will notice is that instead of the “Profile” button on the home screen, you will find a clothes hanger icon. You can click on this icon and start following the same process as the Bedrock edition of the game to change your Minecraft skin.
First thing’s first, you need to know what version of Minecraft you’re playing on. The differences between Minecraft Java and Bedrock are subtle, but can be quite profound on how you change skins in one of these. The new unified Minecraft launcher makes changing skins with Minecraft Java a lot easier, but for Minecraft Bedrock skins things are a little different, especially if you’re not playing on PC.

In order to continue, you’ll need to download the Minecraft skin template online. This template is a very small image having a size of just 64 x 64 pixels, which means that most images added onto it will be significantly larger, and the images that work the best with this type of template is a square image that allows for easy downscaling.
While Bedrock Edition players do not get this same level of total customization, there are ways that they can use custom skins, similar to Java Edition players. However, they can only set custom skins via images on mobile devices or the PC version of Bedrock.
The world of Minecraft is all about customization and standing out. But it isn’t easy to come up with unique ideas in such a massive and happening community. That’s why the internet has a huge collection of Minecraft skins you can download and install to personalize your in-game experience. They are one of the most common and celebrated customization options in the game. Plus, you can find skins inspired by YouTubers, superheroes, and whatnot. We even have a list of the best Minecraft skinsyou can use if you want to take a quick pick. As for the process, it is simple to apply downloaded skins, and the option is available in every Minecraft edition, be it PE, Java, or Bedrock. You can even use most skins interchangeably across editions. But that’s a discussion for later. For now, let’s learn how to download and install Minecraft skins.

## Create a skin of bedrock using a custom image.

There is also a different way for Bedrock Players to get a more customized skin. While this is not as personalized as importing a skin that has been created pixel by pixel, it does allow players to put their own personal touches on their character by using items available that are available in the marketplace.
There can be two ways to edit and make your own custom Minecraft skins. First, you can use the default skin as a model and edit it in any photo editing software like Photoshop. It will give you more customization options and allow you to add photos over it as well. Just make sure to save it as transparent PNG in the same resolution and dimensions as the base skin.
The first step is to select the item in the image you want to be your new Minecraft skin. The desired picture should be a high-resolution image that offers the ability to see the item that you wish to be your new Minecraft skin. Another thing to consider when choosing an image is if the image is a square resolution; it’ll work best with a system like this.
All in all, we hope today's guide at least showed you where to start when it comes to putting a custom image on a skin. Being able to find skins and download them is one thing, but creating your own custom skin is more satisfying. If you're interested in other articles similar to this, we've also got guides on how to upload pictures into Minecraft, and where you can download skins.
Technically, you can use the same PNG skin file in Bedrock or Java editions. But since Bedrock has extra geometrical layers to their skins, you might not see the expected results when you inter-use the skins. Though, using the same skins on different game editions won’t cause any serious problems.
Custom Minecraft skins are very desirable, and nearly everyone that plays Multiplayer regularly has one. We've already made a guide on how to make, edit and change your Minecraft skin, and that process is very similar to this guide. With that being said, let's see how you can put an image onto a Minecraft skin.
You'll need to combine the two images into a single Minecraft skin using the photo editors that are listed above. To do this, users can import and then resize the image to fit over the skin with ease. In addition to resizing, users can reconfigure the image to be better suited to work as a Minecraft skin. This is done by editing the image to fit into the required 64 x 64 pixel size of all Minecraft skins.
In Bedrock Edition, skins can have double the resolution of a normal skin. This means the skin template can be up to 128×128 instead of just 64×64. The normal templates still apply, but players get 4× the amount of pixels to work with, since both dimensions have been doubled. Transparency can be used, even on the first layer, though there needs to be at least one visible pixel, so a fully invisible skin can't be made. The transparency must also be 0% or 100% as translucent colors are not allowed in either layer.
