Sony have teamed up with Mojang on plenty of official skins; allowing PlayStation fans to suit up as one of many iconic characters, including Sackboy and even Ellie from The Last of Us. This skin from Journey is just lovely and really evokes memories of that stunning game. Just don’t remind us of the section in the freezing snow and wind.
Released a while back, the Pharaoh from the official Mythological pack is not only a brilliant design, but also the perfect way to lord it over your mates. If you’re applying this skin and you don’t live in a pyramid, we can’t help you. *cats and eternal wealth not included.
Is it a Halloween film or a Christmas film? Whichever side of the argument you fall on, this official skin of Jack Skellington can be seen as either incredibly cute, or nightmare fuel. As part of a brilliant skin pack, it was tough choosing between Jack or Oogie Boogie.
Bloom is as vibrant as any texture pack on this list, but it also manages to somehow strike a balance between familiarity and cartooniness with its charming repeating textures. The world looks great but the items are where Bloom really shines, looking like they've been plucked out of an SNES game. It makes me much more excited about working my way up to powerful items like Potions and Enchanted tools.

There's a stunning variety of Minecraft texture packs out there nowadays. Some packs update every single block in the game to look different, while others only change one or two block types. Some aim to make Minecraft's textures as realistic and high resolution as possible, while others opt for a more stylised, thematic approach.
PC players have the advantage here, though. With every player being able to browse online and simply install a .PNG file into the game itself. Or, if you’re particularly creative, you can design a skin yourself. All done through Skindex or various websites.
Jolicraft is an interesting mix of vibrant colours and more muted pastel colours. This mix adds a very powerful and bold look to any Minecraft landscape. I particularly love the new textures for the different Minecraft mobs, both passive and hostile. The Endermen are wonderful.
Of course, The Skindex is full of anything and everything, all of varying quality – From the very basic, to intricate designs which would rival the designers at Mojang. Often there are original creations, skins which dodge copyright licences or multiple versions of characters which change incrementally from one to the next.
I remember using Faithful what feels like (and could well have been) nearly a decade ago. It's one of the longest-standing texture packs, and it rose to stardom by remaining - you guessed it - incredibly faithful to the vanilla textures. It's all very unintimidating, familiar, and easy to get used to. If default Minecraft had 32x32 textures, it would look like this.
Yes, it’s a second Star Wars skin, but no list would be complete without Mando, would it? Disney+ sensation, The Mandalorian has only recently dropped within an official skin pack on Minecraft. Now players can suit up in the finest Beskar, with Baby Yoda AKA The Child following along behind. This is the way.
