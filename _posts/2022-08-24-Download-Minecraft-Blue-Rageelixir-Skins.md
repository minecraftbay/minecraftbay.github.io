## Download minecraft skins to change the way you look in-game.

Minecraftskins.net is a good starting point where you can browse and download a Minecraft skin but also edit a skin and create your own. All the necessary editing tools are available and I like that you can change the pose of your character so see more fully what you have created.

Nova Skin has a great interface to work with, bright and colourful for students – almost feels like you’re in Minecraft designing this character. Change the editor background to a number of available Minecraft images. All the creative tools expected are available with addition of a couple of tools I like – the Camera to take a snapshot of your skin and also a GIF tool to create an animated GIF of your creation which you can also download.

When you first open Blockbench you might think you’ve opened a professional photo editing program, it just has that appearance. But do not hesitate to start using it. You will find it very intuitive and before long you will have the skills to not only create character skins for Minecraft Education Edition but also other models and items for Minecraft. You are really creating from scratch here – there are no user created catalogues to access other than your own.
Once they've created or selected their skin, they will need to get it onto their Windows 10 device. Every Minecraft skin website that lets users create or choose a skin should have the option to Download or Save that skin. When prompted to save the file, they can select Save.

Minecraft has been known as a game that wants to do good.

Marvel released about three different skin packs for Minecraft Legacy Console Edition, which is a nice bonus for those playing Minecraft on such a special edition.

In 2016, Minecraft released a very special Minecon skin pack, which was themed around some of the features that developers were planning on introducing.
