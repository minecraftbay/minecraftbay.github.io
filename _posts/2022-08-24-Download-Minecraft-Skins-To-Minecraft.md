You can use the Bedrock Edition tutorial earlier in this article to install new skins in the Pocket Edition of Minecraft. The major difference you will notice is that instead of the “Profile” button on the home screen, you will find a clothes hanger icon. You can click on this icon and start following the same process as the Bedrock edition of the game to change your Minecraft skin.
If you can't find the perfect Minecraft skin for you, consider creating your own with our Minecraft Skin Editor! Who knows, maybe you'll have so much fun, you'll upload skins for others to download! Whether you're a novice or advanced Minecraft skinner, you can find inspiration for your next skin by browsing trending Minecraft skins. New personas, characters, objects and artistic interpretations are uploaded every day! You can learn new skin design techniques by studying the details of your favorite Minecraft skins or following tutorials on Minecraft Skinning.
3. Now, the launcher will ask you to load your custom skin. Here, click on the “Browse”button to select your download PNG skin file. You can use the player model as classic or slim. Once your skin is selected, you can click the “Save & Use” button to apply it immediately.
Since Pocket Edition v0.11.0 alpha, players can choose one of the two default skins either Steve or Alex, and can apply their own custom skin. (Uses the same format as the Java edition). The player must select a valid skin image from their photo library, and must choose between the two main models. Players can also spend Minecraft Coins to buy skin packs. The Legacy Skin Pack was also implemented in Bedrock Edition, but the player has to sign in to Xbox Live to access all the skins. It also includes five anonymous skins. Players can also make their own skin packs, which must include a manifest.json file, a skins.json file, and all the desired skins. An additional .lang file can be added inside a folder labeled texts to display the skin names, but the game can register the skins without it.

## Apply minecraft skins in-game.

There are a couple of ways to create skins for Minecraft. The first way is to use an image editing tool (like Photoshop) and work around one of Mojang’s official Java or Bedrock templates. However, this is harder than using a community-made skin editor. The most popular is the one available at minecraftskins.com (The Skindex).
There can be two ways to edit and make your own custom Minecraft skins. First, you can use the default skin as a model and edit it in any photo editing software like Photoshop. It will give you more customization options and allow you to add photos over it as well. Just make sure to save it as transparent PNG in the same resolution and dimensions as the base skin.
The world of Minecraft is all about customization and standing out. But it isn’t easy to come up with unique ideas in such a massive and happening community. That’s why the internet has a huge collection of Minecraft skins you can download and install to personalize your in-game experience. They are one of the most common and celebrated customization options in the game. Plus, you can find skins inspired by YouTubers, superheroes, and whatnot. We even have a list of the best Minecraft skinsyou can use if you want to take a quick pick. As for the process, it is simple to apply downloaded skins, and the option is available in every Minecraft edition, be it PE, Java, or Bedrock. You can even use most skins interchangeably across editions. But that’s a discussion for later. For now, let’s learn how to download and install Minecraft skins.
The easiest way to customize your Minecraft skin is downloading them. You can download skins for different occasions, characters and purposes. When you find the right skin on Planet Minecraft, you'll see options for changing your skin or downloading the image file to import in your game. If you're using Java Edition, you can simply change your skin and it will automatically upload it to your minecraft.net account. If you're using Windows 10 Bedrock Edition, download the skin file, open Minecraft and import the file from your skin settings. Consider leaving some kind feedback on the skin creators content!
Before you can change your skin, you'll first need to have a new skin to change to. The developers of Minecraft offer a few custom skins for free, usually created in honor of special events. You can also check out websites like The Skindex, which host user-created skins that you can download and use yourself.
While referring to Minecraft skins, we will focus on the skin packs for our protagonist instead of the entities or mobs in the game. That means skins in Minecraft usually refer to the appearance of the main character, which you can customize in unlimited ways. To change other characters’ skins, you will need something called Minecraft resource or texture packs, and you can check out some of the best ones from the linked article. For now, make sure you have a working version of Minecraft, and let’s get started by finding a good skin for your character.
3. Once you are done editing the skin, you can select the Model as Classic or Slim and click on the “Download” button. You can apply it to your character in the same manner as any other downloaded skin. Alternatively, you can also upload your skin to Skindex by clicking on the “Upload to Skindex” button. It’ll let you share your creation with other Minecraft players that use this website.
4. You can then load your self-made skin in the game and even edit it later on Skindex or just classic photo editors as per your preferences. If you want more information on how to make your own Minecraft skin, we have a detailed guide published and linked right here.
