Many fans wonder what texture pack Philza uses. In his streams and videos, players can see a beautiful sky with charming clouds and stars. His sky texture is taken from Dokucraft. Philza uses a custom texture pack made by himself for his Minecraft worlds. He has been generous enough to release it publicly for his dear fans.
Philip "Phil" Watson is a 33-year-old Minecraft YouTuber and Twitch streamer who goes by the name of Ph1Lza. He started his YouTube career back in September of 2006. Currently, he mainly posts recaps of the hardcore world and Dream SMP on Twitch streams.
In Hardcore mode, players have only one life. If they die, they cannot respawn back into their world. Even experienced players have a hard time avoiding death in Minecraft. No wonder Philza is considered one of the best hardcore players, as he has survived for years in his hardcore world.
Philza completely submerged the end spawn island and built an Endlantis, whereas, in the nether realm, he destroyed the hundreds of chunks and created a dark void. Pulling this off takes weeks of work and dedication, which only a few can do. Check out Philza's Twitch, YouTube, and more:

Grian and his long-time girlfriend got engaged in August 2019. The YouTuber posted two Instagram photos announcing the proposal: One showed the gorgeous sea and blue sky that provided a romantic backdrop for the special moment, and the other showed the engagement ring on Grian's fiancée's finger. They married in summer 2020.
