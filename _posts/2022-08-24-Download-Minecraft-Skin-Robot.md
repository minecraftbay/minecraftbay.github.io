## Minecraft skin robot is a program that allows you to download and use custom minecraft skins.

You can make a Minecraft skin through any website that has a skin editor or creator. Alternatively, a program that can modify PNG files like Paint or Photoshop works well too. Both will yield a PNG file that you can upload to skin index websites or your game.
