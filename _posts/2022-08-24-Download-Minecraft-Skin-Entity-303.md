## How to download minecraft skin entity 303.

In "Animation Life 3", Entity assists his allies in avenging Herobrine. He kills several players, but after throwing his scythe Spintown catches it midair, leaving him defenseless. Entity immediately surrenders and is taken into custody by the players. He is last seen being escorted by several players in handcuffs to most likely prison.

As Entity and the rest of the group are ambushed by Alex, Entity is teleported to a different world alongside Alex while Steve fights Herobrine. There, Derp utilizes a fish and repeatedly smacks Entity, forcing him to flee. After Entity receives news that Herobrine has died, he is last seen atop a tree in a jungle.
Along the way, they are ambushed by Alex, who kills Werewolf and confronts Dreadlord. As Dreadlord braces himself, he notices Entity fleeing, and Dreadlord runs away too. The two are met by Herobrine, who arrogantly sends them to retrieve the command block. As Entity ambushes Alex and Steve, He retrieves the block but is hunted by Alex. In a frantic attempt to lose her, Entity enters various mini game. The crowd eventually confront Entity, who flees and drops the Command Block. After Herobrine retrieves the block, he clicks it and vaporizes all the players in the server.
Arbiter 617 unwittingly opens the button to the dimension, where he finds Entity, floating around and fully armed with gear. Entity snarls at Arby, before sending a curse to him and exploding him, leading the stone to break as Entity is freed. Immediately, Entity enters a killing spree. Eventually, he is met by a full armed JapaneseCurry and the two lock in a brutal encounter, in which Entity gains the upper hand.
I checked the server control panel, and it showed we were the only ones on the server. I was getting a bit confused. We all decided to just ignore it and continue on with our survival. It’s about 20 minutes in, and I’m walking with Vincent to the nearest forest to grab wood, which wasn’t very near at all. All of a sudden, we see a white figure in the distance of the desert. It appeared to be in the model of some type of ghostly figure, with what I could barely make out as red eyes. I quickly took a screenshot and ran after it.

For some reason, Vincent’s player just stood still. I assume it’s just lag, but he’s not even speaking on the skype call. I check skype and ask if he’s still online. No answer. He’s not even on the Skype call. By now, Brady is just ignoring us and concentrating on the hotel, and John is freaking out. I can hear the shakiness of his voice. Anyhow, I open up Minecraft again to see that the white figure disappeared, and Vincent disconnected from the server. I try calling him on my phone, but no answer. It goes straight to voice mail. I try texting him, but the texts don’t deliver. John’s getting worried, to the point where it sounds like he’s about to cry. Brady isn’t even listening to us, he’s not aware of the situation at all. I finally get his attention, and he finally realizes how peculiar this problem is. He tps to me and helps me search for the white figure. Now, John’s hysterically crying, thinking that the cheater killed Vincent IRL or something.
I wait about three hours before turning on my computer. The desktop wallpaper was changed to green coding, probably hex. I then realize that literally everything except the Recycling Bin was deleted from my PC. I turn off my computer and use my laptop. I try calling John, but he doesn’t answer. The same goes with Brady and Vincent. I decide to just go to bed and go to school the next day to speak with John and the others the next day. I go to school the next morning, and Brady is the only one to show up. He says that Vin and John’s parents called his parents and ask if John or Vin are at his house. Apparently, they went missing. There was no sign of them, and the police came to their houses and check to see if they were any clues on where they were, but there were no results. I decide to ditch school and walk to John’s house to see if he’s there. I see his mother sitting on the steps, crying. I ask if she’s ok, and she says that John apparently……committed suicide. Not in the house, most likely snuck out to end his life. She handed me a piece of paper that she claimed to have been left on John’s computer table. I read the note carefully. “I can’t take this anymore. I can’t sleep, I’m afraid he’s watching me. I can’t live like this knowing that someone is after me, wanting me to die a slow, painful death. I’m sorry mom……I love you.” I started to cry a bit when I read those last few words. I check the back of the paper, and written on the corner in very small text was that familiar phrase……”MAKE A WISH.”

Entity 303, allegedly called MAKEAWISH in the source codes, is a Minecraft hoax that originated on Youtube in December of 2013. It supposedly haunts Minecraft, seeming to prefer servers (as opposed to Herobrine, who primarily haunts single player worlds). Notchresponded to the hoax by asking believers "what is wrong with you people[?] it[']s just a game" and exclaimed absolutely that there were "no ghosts".
Entity 303 is supposedly capable of lighting players' homes on fire and placing and detonating tnt seemingly at random. Early screenshots of Entity 303 show him to be a white figure in the distance or a player with garbled black and white skin, but he has since been stylized as a pitch black player wearing a white robe.
Minecraft is a game of almost unlimited possibility with gamers creating incredibly detailed movie recreations, villages and more, but that doesn’t really extend to your default character skin. In fact, we think that the default skins in Minecraft leave much to be desired, but without a built-in skin editor, how can you change the skin of your character?
Entity 303 was a cheater who was infamously noted for his habit of cheating accounts and destroying worlds. Eventually, he was captured by Hypixel and imprisoned inside another dimension. He is a member of Herobrine's Gang and one of the three secondary antagonists (next to Null and Dreadlord) of the trilogy of Animation Life.
Entity 303 is believed to have been created by a player by the name of thespeed179 who now makes Minecraft machinimas; Thespeed179 has said since making his original story that Entity 303 is "obviously fake". More players unrelated to thespeed179 have added onto the rumor, and many aspects of Entity 303 common in hoaxes revolving around him, such as a conflict with Herobrine or him formerly being a Mojang employee were not mentioned whatsoever in thespeed179's original story.
