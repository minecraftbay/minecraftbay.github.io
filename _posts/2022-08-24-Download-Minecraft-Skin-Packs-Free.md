While referring to Minecraft skins, we will focus on the skin packs for our protagonist instead of the entities or mobs in the game. That means skins in Minecraft usually refer to the appearance of the main character, which you can customize in unlimited ways. To change other characters’ skins, you will need something called Minecraft resource or texture packs, and you can check out some of the best ones from the linked article. For now, make sure you have a working version of Minecraft, and let’s get started by finding a good skin for your character.
There can be two ways to edit and make your own custom Minecraft skins. First, you can use the default skin as a model and edit it in any photo editing software like Photoshop. It will give you more customization options and allow you to add photos over it as well. Just make sure to save it as transparent PNG in the same resolution and dimensions as the base skin.
