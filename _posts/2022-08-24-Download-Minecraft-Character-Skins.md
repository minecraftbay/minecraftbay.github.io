Download the MCPACK file, then double-click it to open in Minecraft Education Edition. If you have multiple versions of Minecraft installed on your device it would be easier to first open Minecraft Education Edition, then choose to Import the MCPACK file you downloaded.

## Download minecraft character skins for free.

Before you can change your skin, you'll first need to have a new skin to change to. The developers of Minecraft offer a few custom skins for free, usually created in honor of special events. You can also check out websites like The Skindex, which host user-created skins that you can download and use yourself.

1. First, go to the Skindex website and click on any of the skins you like. We will use the Skeleton Gamer skin to demonstrate the steps. You can use the search option at the top to look for a specific character or theme skin. Moreover, check out our lists of the coolest Minecraft skins and the best Minecraft girl skins via the provided links.
Unless you buy them from the official marketplace, all the Minecraft skins available online are free. Though, you can find some paid third-party skin apps on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. But we don’t suggest using them or spending money on them.
There are a couple of ways to create skins for Minecraft. The first way is to use an image editing tool (like Photoshop) and work around one of Mojang’s official Java or Bedrock templates. However, this is harder than using a community-made skin editor. The most popular is the one available at minecraftskins.com (The Skindex).
Whether it’s a separate app or a free online website, make sure to avoid the many fake Minecraft apps while downloading skins. Also, if you wish to show off your creativity and stand out from the crowd, you can even make your own Minecraft skin to usein the game. Irrespective of how you obtain it, let’s go over how to get the Minecraft skin in your game.
I love this so so much it's really easy to add a skin! There are a lot to choose from and when you find the skin that you want you just save it to photos and there you have it! I never thought adding skins in Minecraft was really easy :P I really recommend it!!
Bonus: Skinpack Creator for Minecraft Education Edition: Create a custom skin using one of the tools above. Then fill out the name for your skin, name for the skin pack, and a version number then upload your custom skin image file as a ".png". Then download it and you can open it in Minecraft.
But for the creatives who love the design and crafting aspects of Minecraft, don't worry: In reality, your character's cosmetic choices are virtually limitless. For Java edition users, you can find or create a skin, upload it, and enjoy. And Bedrock users have that option and more through its character creator tool.
