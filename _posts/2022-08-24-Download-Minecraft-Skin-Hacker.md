this minecraft skin app is by far the best one i have downloaded it has pre-set skins AND this is one of the few (i mean like 20 ;-; ) of the skin apps that let you decorise your OWN skin what i love most about this app is the decorise option(a.k.a the creative) you can make your character look however you want! and if you mess up DonT WOrrY cHilD TheReS An EarAsEr but there is ONE thing that could make it better: if you pick a color from the wheel it shows up at the bottom,example OH IM GONNA PICK THE SKIN COLOR AND ITS SUPER HARD TO PICK IT AGAIN, so what im proposing is that if you pick a color from the wheel,it shows up on the bottom so you dont have to keep raging on the things like:skin color,clothes color,hair color,etc etc etc etc etc etc etc. and im pretty shure i wasted your time on. reading this review :3 baiiii!!!!!!!!!
