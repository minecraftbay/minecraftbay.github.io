The beauty of Minecraft is that you can mod it to be completely unrecognizable. I know you’ve probably played Tekkit, FTB, or any of those amazing mod packs. Modding is fun and you know you love it! And modding isn’t all about adding a portal gun to your game, you can add helpful tools to make your time as a builder so much easier.
A lot of you are probably already familiar with this mod. It has been used in many modpacks over the years, and is a great mod for survival base building. Imagine giving Minecraft the same tools as Factorio. Streamline your mining, farming, and base building in one mod!
There are also some experimental features from The Wild Update, letting players test parts of the upcoming, content-packed release without enrolling in the recent Minecraft: Bedrock Edition betas and Previews. An early version of the upcoming Spectator Mode is also included in this build, but Mojang Studios notes that this feature isn't in active testing, yet, and won't arrive until after The Wild Update releases later in 2022.
Minecraft is an inarguable and complete success. It has sold copies in the hundreds of millions, has a huge following of dedicated players, and lets you unlock your every creative desire. The 1.18.30 patch update for Minecraft brings with it brand-new features, changes, and improvements.

This mod has builders like you in mind. The Building Gadgets mod has 2 gadgets which let you control building different structures with ease. These gadgets are really handy when you need to build a big structure but don’t want to place every block, and it works in survival!
Industrial Craft is another mod you might know already. It is found in modpacks like FTB. This mod is great for completely changing survival building by adding new ways to automate your processes with new and industrial techniques. This is perfect if you like to streamline everything.
