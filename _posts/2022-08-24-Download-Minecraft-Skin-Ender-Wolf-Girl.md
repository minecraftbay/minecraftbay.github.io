## Download minecraft skin ender wolf girl.

As it is seen on the screenshot you use other texturepacks or resourcepacks. They may conflict so you cant't use them together as they will behave uncorrectly. Just as we see on the screenshot.I suggest you to move my RP above the pack that changes wolf's texture/model as well in "Resourcepacks" page in "Options". The other solution is to completely remove that other pack.I have no other idea of how to fix your problem. Try these. I hope, they'll workGood luck＼（〇_ｏ）／

Unlike endermen, they (obviously) can't pick up blocks. They won't be attacked by the enderdragon, unless they are owned by the player. Unlike regular wolves, they can go through the nether and the end and vice versa when tamed. They can be fed certain food to restore their health:

!REQUIERS OPTIFINE!The resourcepack changes models of dogs so they are little cute baby dragons now ヾ(•ω•`)oTamed ones even have a bell attached to their collar! (And they change color as well as collar does I thought of changing sounds as well. And RP now changes wolf's sounds. Hooray!!!\^o^/
+new collar models (It now hangs on wolf's mane)+spawn egg texture was changed for a bit+main feature of the update are the sounds! Changed sounds:bark, panting, shake, whine, hurt, death and growl.(Actually, they're just enderdragon's sounds taken from Minecraft that I changed a bit so they sound like baby dragon sounds)+texture and model were changed for the future updates
