## Minecraft is a popular video game that lets players create and play with virtual blocks.

Minecraft has more of a fixed mechanics system. The game is played from a first- or third-person perspective, and allows you to engage in basic activities like building, mining, farming and fighting with a melee weapon. There are no guns in Minecraft (unless you mod the game), and the combat is decidedly non-violent and “cartoony”, with very simple animations.

Minecraft vs. Roblox is a big battle between two of the leading sandbox games. They both let players build and explore worlds, go on adventures alongside others, and create something akin to using digital Lego bricks. Even so, there are differences you’ll want to know about before choosing one. This post will look at Minecraft vs. Roblox in a number of areas, and which one’s best for you (or your child).
Minecraft is top-notch when it comes to mods, especially for younger players. You can use a number of different programming languages, such as Java and Python. What’s more, there are many course platforms that let you learn how to both code and mod Minecraft at the same time – Tynker is a standout service.
But what’s really given Minecraft its longevity is the Creative mode, which removes health and the mining mechanics to let you loose and create without fear of attacks from enemies. Some of the creations that people have made over the years have been nothing short of incredible, and really justify the game’s label as “virtual Lego.”
The most common edition of Minecraft out there currently, and the most robust. This version lets you crossplay with people across all platforms. A key thing to note is that most versions of “Bedrock Edition” are actually just called “Minecraft” these days, and the default versions you’ll find on PS4/PS5, Xbox, PC, Android and iOS are indeed the Bedrock Edition.

The one where it all started. The Java Edition of Minecraft in some ways represents the true freedom and original experience of Minecraft. In some ways, the Java Edition is the “Roblox of Minecraft,” in that it’s a pretty open platform that can be heavily modded and on top of which players can build their own standalone games (like Bed Wars).
Even though I'm a videogame player, I hadn't played Minecraft until it was recently added to the XBox Game Pass on windows. I can see why it is so attractive to kids. I didn't know a lot about it so the first time I came across a village was really surprising. Then I got lost and spent tons of time trying to find my way back to my base. Minecraft is a pretty amazing game. I'm only a decade late to finding it out!
Examining cross-device play in Minecraft vs. Roblox is another way the two games differ. With Roblox, you can play on your Android mobile while someone else in the room will be on their Windows PC. With Minecraft, you can play both Java Edition and Bedrock Edition with others, but you can’t mix the editions.
This version of the game is designed for the classroom, teaching children to code, design games within Minecraft, and have a ton of fun while doing it. This version comes with over 600 lessons (and the ability to create your own), as well as other teacher-oriented features like collaboration on documents, assessments and coding information.

## Some users have created skin mods that change the appearance of blocks or the player.

A custom skin is a way to personalize the player model and can be done either by using a variety of community-made skin editors, or by editing the steve.png or alex.png file manually with an image editor like Photoshop, GIMP, Paint.net or similar image editors. The steve.png file can be downloaded here and the alex.png file here. When editing the steve.png or alex.png file manually, be sure to keep the original image dimensions and make the background of the skin (the unused pixels) completely transparent. Otherwise, Minecraft may fail to recognize the skin as intended.
Alternatively, some may find it easier to use a program, either downloadable or in-browser, which provides a live view of their character on a three-dimensional model as they are editing the skin. For example, programs may further assist players by providing them with a wide variety of pre-made selections (such as hats, boots, sweaters, etc.), to give the skin creator exactly what they want, even if the creator has little to no artistic skill.
Only players who have purchased Minecraft can change their character's skin. This is done on the profile page or in the Minecraft Launcher by uploading a valid .png texture that is 64×64 pixels, or a legacy texture that is 64×32 pixels, which then replaces the default skin.
The character creator is a feature in Bedrock Edition (and was in Minecraft Earth until discontinuation) that lets players customize their skins with free and paid-for cosmetic items. It can be accessed by selecting the character profile button on the main menu. It can also be used to equip capes. Many clothing items cost Minecoins (Tokens on PlayStation 4), or can be earned by completing certain achievements.
Disclaimer: Some of these mods contain material that could make people feel uncomfortable or disturbed, such as flashing lights, screen shaking, sexual character design, controversial activity by mod creators and contributors, etc. Any notices are listed on the respective character pages.
After making a custom skin, either by using a skin editor or by editing the steve.png file directly, one still needs to upload the .png file at the Skin section of the Profile page on Minecraft.net (found here) before the skin is applied. Other players in multiplayer can also see this skin. Note that players cannot see the custom skin if they are not logged in or when playing offline.
In Bedrock Edition, skins can have double the resolution of a normal skin. This means the skin template can be up to 128×128 instead of just 64×64. The normal templates still apply, but players get 4× the amount of pixels to work with, since both dimensions have been doubled. Transparency can be used, even on the first layer, though there needs to be at least one visible pixel, so a fully invisible skin can't be made. The transparency must also be 0% or 100% as translucent colors are not allowed in either layer.
Since Pocket Edition v0.11.0 alpha, players can choose one of the two default skins either Steve or Alex, and can apply their own custom skin. (Uses the same format as the Java edition). The player must select a valid skin image from their photo library, and must choose between the two main models. Players can also spend Minecraft Coins to buy skin packs. The Legacy Skin Pack was also implemented in Bedrock Edition, but the player has to sign in to Xbox Live to access all the skins. It also includes five anonymous skins. Players can also make their own skin packs, which must include a manifest.json file, a skins.json file, and all the desired skins. An additional .lang file can be added inside a folder labeled texts to display the skin names, but the game can register the skins without it.
