Minecraft is a game of almost unlimited possibility with gamers creating incredibly detailed movie recreations, villages and more, but that doesn’t really extend to your default character skin. In fact, we think that the default skins in Minecraft leave much to be desired, but without a built-in skin editor, how can you change the skin of your character?
If you downloaded the APK file on your computer, the process is slightly different. You must connect your Android device to the PC and enable USB mass-storage mode. The next step is to drag and drop the file onto your device. Then, using a file manager, such as Astro or ES File Explorer, you can locate the file on your device and install it.
2. Scroll through the available characters and click Edit Character under one of your existing models, or select one of the blank slots and then click Create Character. If you're making a new character, it doesn't matter whether you pick Character or Classic Skin in the pop-up that appears.
If you haven't installed any other programs that associate with the APK file type, BlueStacks will automatically open APK files. Double-click the file to launch BlueStacks and install the app. You can also drag-and-drop the APK file onto the BlueStacks home screen. Confirm that you want to install the app, and it will appear on your BlueStacks home screen after installing.
