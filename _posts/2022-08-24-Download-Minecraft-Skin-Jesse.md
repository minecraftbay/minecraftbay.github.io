The power of Minecraft extends far beyond the blocky boundaries of its game world. It is obviously an amazing tool for expressing creativity, considering how free you are to shape and build the world into just about anything you can imagine, but it has also allowed for those passionate about the game to launch entire careers off of it. There are people who do "let's plays," show off amazing builds, do challenges, speedrun, and more for millions of fans.
