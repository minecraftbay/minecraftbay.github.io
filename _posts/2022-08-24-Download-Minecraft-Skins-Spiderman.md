Minecraft is a game of almost unlimited possibility with gamers creating incredibly detailed movie recreations, villages and more, but that doesn’t really extend to your default character skin. In fact, we think that the default skins in Minecraft leave much to be desired, but without a built-in skin editor, how can you change the skin of your character?

One of the best Spider-Man movies, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse features protagonist Miles Morales – a young teen living in Brooklyn, New York who takes on the role of Spider-Man after the death of his predecessor Peter Parker. This Minecraft skin features the iconic green and red hoodie, with the black and red Spidey suit underneath.

It’s also quick and easy to switch out new skins using the Bedrock Edition’s character creator, so you can customise your avatar with all your favourite superheroes. If you’ve just binged the first three Spider-Man films, you can suit up in the classic red and blue suit. If you’ve watched the latest Spider-Man film, No Way Home, then you whip out the gold adorned Spidey skin. Or if you’re a fan of the Miles Morales videogame and loved Into the Spider-Verse, then you can suit up as Miles Morales himself.
If you’d rather suit up as one of Spider-Man’s most notorious enemies, the Green Goblin skin is sure to frighten lurking creepers. It doesn’t come with the killer helmet or the snazzy glider, but it does feature an evil snare and those infamous glowing yellow eyes.
It was previously reported that the Fortnite/Marvel comic book series Zero War – which kicks off June 8 – would include two new Marvel skins as codes with certain issues, including the imminent first one. This has now been decrypted by Fortnite dataminers as Spider-Man Zero, Fortnite’s first completely unique Marvel outfit.
