I am highly disappointed in this game. At first it let me scroll through the skins, But then as I scrolled farther down, it just kicked me off! And then I decided I should try to redownload the app... Bad mistake! I didn't even scroll down yet and it still kicked me off!! Please fix this!!!! Thanks!
Many Dream fans are curious about how they can get his skin in the game, as his skin is quite unique. It features a green and white color palette with quite a basic drawing of a face. Fans have loved this minimalism and it gives his character a unique aura.
