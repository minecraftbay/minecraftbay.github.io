## Download minecraft skins with capes.

Download a skin with capes. If you're using Bedrock Edition on Android, iOS, or Windows, or a console, some skins in the Marketplace come with capes. If you buy a skin from the Minecraft Marketplace that comes with a cape, you can equip the cape as a cosmetic item through the Character Creator.XResearch source

Use a mod (java edition). The only way to get new capes in the Java version of Minecraft is to use a mod. Technically you can get all kinds of capes using Minecraft mods, but other players won't see them unless they're using the same mod as you. It's still worth a shot to check out these mods:
Although players can get a free cape in Minecraft Java Edition, this game version is quite limited when it comes to skin selection. You can get various capes using mods, but other players will only see them if they have the same mod. If you want to obtain a cape for personal reasons rather than to show off, though, it’s worth a shot. Here are some of the best mods allowing you to wear a cape in Minecraft Java:
While you can purchase a pre-made caped skin, all methods of obtaining a cape in Minecraft described in previous sections are free. Java Edition players can get a free cape for migrating their Mojang account. Both Java and Bedrock Edition players can create custom cape designs and upload them to Minecraft.net, cost-free. Most mods also don’t require players to pay anything to use them. In other words, a cape in Minecraft isn’t some kind of lavish piece available only for nobles.
Once your cape is active, you should see it appear on your character the next time you open the game. If it's not, make sure that you have OptiFine installed and capes turned on in-game: Open Options, then Skin Customization, and then make sure Cape is set to ON.

Minecraft Java and Bedrock Editions differ significantly. When it comes to capes, each one has its pros and cons. While more caped skins are available online for the Bedrock Edition, Java allows more cape customization options. More mods are available for Java, and they are generally easier to install. Plus, as mentioned in previous sections, Java Edition players can now receive a free cape for migrating their Mojang account to Microsoft account. The physics are different, too. Surprisingly, an older Java Edition released in 2011 offers more realistic cape physics. The cape can move freely in all directions, while in Bedrock, it can only move up and down. In other words, if a cape is truly important for you, Minecraft Java Edition is a better option.
Recently, Minecraft developers issued a notice for Java Edition players. All Mojang accounts have to be migrated to Microsoft accounts. This requirement is related to safety reasons and is mandatory, though the exact date of the migration period end is yet unknown. If a player fails to move the account, they won’t be able to play the Java Edition anymore.

## Create minecraft skins with capes.

A popular mod for getting capes is Advanced Capes Mod, which you can install as long as you have Minecraft Forge. Once you're using Advanced Capes Mod, you can set your cape by pressing the C key and adding the URL of your cape. To make your own cape from scratch, download the cape template, edit it with Paint (or any editing app you like, and then upload the edited version to a free image hosting site like Imgur.XResearch source
As you can see, obtaining a cape in Minecraft is fairly simple. The best thing is, just like with building, you can use your imagination to its full extent when creating your outfit. Get a free cape for migrating your Mojang account, or make a one-of-a-kind design on your own and shine on. Hopefully, the upcoming game updates will improve the cape graphics in Bedrock Edition for an even better user experience.
Skins and capes are pretty common in Minecraft. Most gamers don't use the standard Alex or Steve skin that the game provides. Rather, they use either a custom skin or a purchased one, sometimes even editing skins and adding capes, hats and other cosmetics to them. This is more frequent on Java Edition, though, as editing and downloading custom skins is much easier there.
Capes are commonly used as a symbol of superiority in comics, movies, and multiplication. This piece of apparel is admired by superheroes and magicians alike (though supervillains, Dracula, and other unpleasant creatures may wear it, too). Minecraft allows players to wear various capes.
