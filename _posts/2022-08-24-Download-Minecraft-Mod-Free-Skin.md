Minecraft has more of a fixed mechanics system. The game is played from a first- or third-person perspective, and allows you to engage in basic activities like building, mining, farming and fighting with a melee weapon. There are no guns in Minecraft (unless you mod the game), and the combat is decidedly non-violent and “cartoony”, with very simple animations.
Minecraft is a 3Dsandbox game that has no required goals to accomplish, allowing players a large amount of freedom in choosing how to play the game. However, there is an achievement system, known as "advancements" in the Java Edition of the game, and "trophies" on the PlayStation ports. Gameplay is in the first-person perspective by default, but players have the option for third-person perspective. The game world is composed of rough 3D objects—mainly cubes and fluids, and commonly called "blocks"—representing various materials, such as dirt, stone, ores, tree trunks, water, and lava. The core gameplay revolves around picking up and placing these objects. These blocks are arranged in a 3D grid, while players can move freely around the world. Players can "mine" blocks and then place them elsewhere, enabling them to build things. Many commentators have described the game's physics system as unrealistic. The game also contains a material called redstone, which can be used to make primitive mechanical devices, electrical circuits, and logic gates, allowing for the construction of many complex systems.
In the form of an independent video game, it initially developed from individuals, not organizations. Few people think that Minecraft has the top performance on all platforms from Windows, Android, iOS, xBox, … Players are free to build on their own creativity while playing. A large place is welcoming you to many interesting features. Don’t let you wait any longer, let’s see what game modes are available below.
Minecraft is an amazing game thanks largely to a massive community of creative individuals who spend their free time tweaking, modifying, and overhauling just about every aspect of the experience. The game can be played in its "vanilla" version quite easily on OS X -- and to be fair the original, untouched game is still an absolute blast to play -- but once you've gotten an eyeful of what the modding community has done to developer Mojang's surreal sandbox, it's hard to go back.

Modders put tireless effort into their creations, and while it would be nice for all mods to work on all versions of Minecraft, the reality is that it's just not reasonable to expect every mod to be updated in a timely manner. Depending on the mods you want to install, you may need to rollback your Minecraft version to a previous release. Thankfully, the Minecraft client makes this a pretty simple affair.

## Some of the more popular mods include skins, which are simple modifications to the game’s visuals.

In Minecraft, mods are a way to modify the game using customized items and functions. They can be used to change the way the game looks and feels. New items, blocks, and even mobs can be added to make for a refreshing change of pace and increase the game’s replay value. Additionally, skins can be applied to players' character models to add a personal touch.
Not all mods will add gameplay elements, however. Others merely tweak the GUI, for example by adding a minimap, try to smoothen the game rendering, like OptiFine, or by allowing the player to browse through all the items in both the base game and the player's mods and look up how to craft them, like JEI (Just Enough Items).
Mods, short for "modifications," are pieces of software that can change how "Minecraft" works. Some mods alter the rules of the time-space continuum. Some can change enemies into immensely powerful zombies. Combine a few mods, like introducing flags and custom weapons, and you can transform your game into a heated match of Capture the Flag with friends.
Ok, so you've got the game up and running, you've changed your character skin and given your Minecraft world a whole new look, but now it's time to take the next step. Mods are different from the tweaks covered above in that they fundamentally alter how the game functions, instead of just upgrading its looks. Because of this, installing mods is a slightly more involved process.

The modding community consists of fans, users and third-party programmers. Using a variety of application program interfaces that have arisen over time, they have produced a wide variety of downloadable content for Minecraft, such as modifications, texture packs and custom maps. Modifications of the Minecraft code, called mods, add a variety of gameplay changes, ranging from new blocks, new items, new mobs to entire arrays of mechanisms to craft. The modding community is responsible for a substantial supply of mods from ones that enhance gameplay, such as minimaps, waypoints, and durability counters, to ones that add to the game elements from other video games and media. While a variety of mod frameworks were independently developed by reverse engineering the code, Mojang has also enhanced vanillaMinecraft with official frameworks for modification, allowing the production of community-created resource packs, which alter certain game elements including textures and sounds. Players can also create their own "maps" (custom world save files) which often contain specific rules, challenges, puzzles and quests, and share them for others to play. Mojang added an adventure mode in August 2012 and "command blocks" in October 2012, which were created specially for custom maps in Java Edition. Data packs, introduced in version 1.13 of the Java Edition, allow further customization, including the ability to add new advancements, dimensions, functions, loot tables, predicates, recipes, structures, tags, world generation settings, and biomes‌.
