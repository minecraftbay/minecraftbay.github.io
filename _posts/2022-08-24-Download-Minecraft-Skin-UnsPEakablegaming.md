It's not uncommon to see Super Mario and Nintendo inspired skins and content in Minecraft, but this Mario skin in particular is very special, because of how narrow its release was. It was within a Super Mario themed skin pack with a bunch of other famous Nintendo characters, and the pack was initially released in 2016, making it pretty old.
This skin might not look like much or anything special, but it's a really cool throwback for long-time fans of the Tony Hawk franchise. Not to mention, it's definitely among the rarest skins for the console due to how limited edition the pack it came with was.

All versions of Minecraft, Java Edition, or Windows 10 (Bedrock) support custom skins, making it easy for users to pick from a large selection as well as create some of their own. Being able to create your own personal skin in Minecraft is something fans truly appreciate. It lets them add a bit of a personal touch to their favorite game.
The skin pack was actually only available for those playing Minecraft on Wii U or Nintendo Switch, which means only a small handful of players actually ever got their hands on this super exclusive skin pack and its version of the iconic Mario character.
