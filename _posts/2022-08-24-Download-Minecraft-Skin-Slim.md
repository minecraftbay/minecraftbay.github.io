## Minecraftskinslim is a great way to get a slimmer look for your minecraft characters.

But for the creatives who love the design and crafting aspects of Minecraft, don't worry: In reality, your character's cosmetic choices are virtually limitless. For Java edition users, you can find or create a skin, upload it, and enjoy. And Bedrock users have that option and more through its character creator tool.

Similar to Java Edition, you can upload a skin you got from the internet, or one you've created yourself for your Bedrock character model. With tons of creative Minecraft users eager to share their skins, you can find almost any cosmetic you can dream up.
Before you can change your skin, you'll first need to have a new skin to change to. The developers of Minecraft offer a few custom skins for free, usually created in honor of special events. You can also check out websites like The Skindex, which host user-created skins that you can download and use yourself.
2. Scroll through the available characters and click Edit Character under one of your existing models, or select one of the blank slots and then click Create Character. If you're making a new character, it doesn't matter whether you pick Character or Classic Skin in the pop-up that appears.
