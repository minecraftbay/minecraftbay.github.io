Put simply, a Minecraft skin is just an image that will determine exactly how your character looks in game. Players use different skins to change their character's appearance and many of the latest and best Minecraft skins keep up with current fashion trends. Skins in Minecraft are a great way for players to express themselves.

## Use the minecraft skin selector tool.

Before you can change your skin, you'll first need to have a new skin to change to. The developers of Minecraft offer a few custom skins for free, usually created in honor of special events. You can also check out websites like The Skindex, which host user-created skins that you can download and use yourself.
There can be two ways to edit and make your own custom Minecraft skins. First, you can use the default skin as a model and edit it in any photo editing software like Photoshop. It will give you more customization options and allow you to add photos over it as well. Just make sure to save it as transparent PNG in the same resolution and dimensions as the base skin.
Changing a Minecraft skin depends on what platform you are using. To change skin in Minecraft Java Edition, simply login to the official Minecraft website with your Microsoft account and upload your desired skin file. For pocket edition/console versions of Minecraft, simply access the wardobe/current skins page through the main menu and change your skin through that.
There are a couple of ways to create skins for Minecraft. The first way is to use an image editing tool (like Photoshop) and work around one of Mojang’s official Java or Bedrock templates. However, this is harder than using a community-made skin editor. The most popular is the one available at minecraftskins.com (The Skindex).
While referring to Minecraft skins, we will focus on the skin packs for our protagonist instead of the entities or mobs in the game. That means skins in Minecraft usually refer to the appearance of the main character, which you can customize in unlimited ways. To change other characters’ skins, you will need something called Minecraft resource or texture packs, and you can check out some of the best ones from the linked article. For now, make sure you have a working version of Minecraft, and let’s get started by finding a good skin for your character.
3. Once you are done editing the skin, you can select the Model as Classic or Slim and click on the “Download” button. You can apply it to your character in the same manner as any other downloaded skin. Alternatively, you can also upload your skin to Skindex by clicking on the “Upload to Skindex” button. It’ll let you share your creation with other Minecraft players that use this website.
But for the creatives who love the design and crafting aspects of Minecraft, don't worry: In reality, your character's cosmetic choices are virtually limitless. For Java edition users, you can find or create a skin, upload it, and enjoy. And Bedrock users have that option and more through its character creator tool.
3. Now, the launcher will ask you to load your custom skin. Here, click on the “Browse”button to select your download PNG skin file. You can use the player model as classic or slim. Once your skin is selected, you can click the “Save & Use” button to apply it immediately.
