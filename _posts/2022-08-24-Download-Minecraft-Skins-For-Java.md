Most people tend to take a ‘set it and forget it’ approach to their Minecraft skin, and it’s easy to see why. Minecraft is primarily a first-person game, so you only see your skin in the crafting menu, and even then it’ll likely be covered with armour most of the time. However, it’s such a simple and fun way to express yourself, especially when playing on a multiplayer server. Whether it’s an exciting design or based on existing media, we’ve collected the best skins across all platforms.
Minecraft is the best selling game of all time – and for good reason. Its near infinite worlds and extensive customisation options give players a sense of freedom and control that is unparalleled in gaming. Since Minecraft‘s initial release in 2009, it has sold over 238 million copies and, as of 2021, had 140 million active monthly players. That’s seriously impressive. And each one of those millions of players can make the world of Minecraft their own. One way to do that is through the customisation of skins. “Skins” are textures that are placed on player or mob models to give them different looks. This functionality is hugely popular in Minecraft – but how exactly do skins work in the game? This is our “Minecraft Skins How To” Ultimate Guide, designed to teach you everything there is to know about skins in Minecraft…
Skins change how your character looks in the game of Minecraft. Everyone starts with the classic Steve and Alex skins but players customize their avatar by downloading or creating custom skins. It's like character creation except while you're limited by the simplistic blocky model, you have unlimited possibilities because every pixel matters. Technically, a Minecraft skin is just a small .png image file that wraps around your player model changing its appearance in the game. You don't have to settle with one persona when you can choose from over a million custom skins uploaded by the community to Planet Minecraft!
As mentioned, Minecraft skins are the different and unique looks that can be applied to player and mob models in the game. They are divided into surface areas such as front head area, right leg area etc. Skins come in two layers. The first is where things like eyes, clothes and hair sit. The second layer is used for character accessories like glasses and hats.

## There are many different ways to get skins.

You can download skins from any websites that offer them. These skins are also available for editing if you think a personal touch makes them better. Not all websites come with editors, but if you have a program that can edit PNG files, then you can also edit them on your computer.
Before you can change your skin, you'll first need to have a new skin to change to. The developers of Minecraft offer a few custom skins for free, usually created in honor of special events. You can also check out websites like The Skindex, which host user-created skins that you can download and use yourself.
Thanks to the synced environment, you can use the same method to get your Minecraft skin on all platforms of the Bedrock edition. It’s almost the same as the method on Minecraft Pocket Edition. You can even use the following method on the Minecraft 1.19 beta.
Once you've created or selected your skin, you'll need to get it onto your Windows 10 device. Every Minecraft skin website that lets you create or choose a skin should have the option to Download or Save your skin. When prompted to save the file, select Save.
Thanks to the connective world of Bedrock edition, you can sync your skin on all your devices. To do so, make sure to turn off the “only allow trusted skins” toggle under your profile settings. Or you can manually get your skins on each device using the above-mentioned methods.
3. In the new section that opens up, click on the “browse” option and select the PNG file of your skin. Then you can name the skin under the “name” tab. As for the player model, selecting the “slim” option can get you slightly skinnier player arms. Finally, click on the “save” or “save & use” option to store and equip the skin.
2. Scroll through the available characters and click Edit Character under one of your existing models, or select one of the blank slots and then click Create Character. If you're making a new character, it doesn't matter whether you pick Character or Classic Skin in the pop-up that appears.
The game has seen a ton of crossovers within the community, so it's only natural to place some Among Us skins online. There are also many color variations of this skin, and even some placing the crew member in different outfits mirroring the way gamers can customize their character in Among Us.
