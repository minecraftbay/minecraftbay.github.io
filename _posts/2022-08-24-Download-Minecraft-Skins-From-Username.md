Playing Minecraft, everyone wants to show their personality. And the mining craft simulator fully satisfies this desire of the user: the free world, open for exploration and the possibility to build any buildings and mechanisms leave room for imagination.

I like this app a lot. I used it to both download and create many of my own skins when i was younger, and I returned recently to get back on making my own skins. It has the good capabilities of many skin creators, including changing brightness, darkness, and saturation, and editing lassoed areas or filling areas with color boundaries. However, my main issue recently has been importing skins from the camera roll. when I exported a photo from skindex and imported it into Skinseed to further edit, the transfer didn’t work. The skin didn’t load. :/ Other than this bug, I’ve liked this app fairly well, and although it has its limitations such as only showing one surface face at a time, overall this leads to better accessability. If you are new to Minecraft or looking for a good skin app, get this one. Even if you don’t like to make your own skins or pixel art it has tons and tons of skins to pick from. Keep in mind most of the community skins only work on pocket edition and not Java (on computer, uses a launcher.) My main issue is importing skins from photos not working. Please fix this devs.
The first and foremost and also the very important thing is – you must have an account in Microsoft. For PC, you need to have to log in with the same Microsoft account on the Microsoft store otherwise you won’t be able to download the Minecraft launcher.
