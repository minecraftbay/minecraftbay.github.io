## Create a skin for your minecraft character that is inspired by the red girl from the “wolfenstein” video game series.

The Little Red Riding Hood skin is another great Minecraft skin, featuring a brown-haired girl in a simple white shirt with her infamous red cloak. The cloak adds an element of contrast to the skin and goes well with the white and black that this skin boasts.

It's like character creation except while you're limited by the simplistic blocky model, you have unlimited possibilities because every pixel matters. Technically, a Minecraft skin is just a small .png image file that wraps around your player model changing its appearance in the game. You don't have to settle with one persona when you can choose from over a million custom skins uploaded by the community to Planet Minecraft!

Here's a pirate-themed total conversion for Wolfenstein 3D, a sentence that feels particularly wonderful to type. Creator fraggeur's mod The Golden Parrot has just hit version 1.0, and it changes up the base game to a surprising degree. You'll notice that the very grey corridors of the original Wolf3D have been replaced with a colourful, tropical landscape, while its Nazis have shuffled off in favour of pirates swinging cutlasses like there's no tomorrow.

## Download the skin and install it on your minecraft character.

The easiest way to customize your Minecraft skin is downloading them. You can download skins for different occasions, characters and purposes. When you find the right skin on Planet Minecraft, you'll see options for changing your skin or downloading the image file to import in your game. If you're using Java Edition, you can simply change your skin and it will automatically upload it to your minecraft.net account. If you're using Windows 10 Bedrock Edition, download the skin file, open Minecraft and import the file from your skin settings. Consider leaving some kind feedback on the skin creators content!
Craig's take: "When they create these designs, one of the elements you don't think about when you're creating it... when you move your arm across your chest, that's one of the main places you're going to put your arm, but now you're going to be hitting this lion head all the time. If you raise your left arm, does that lion mane stick up and poke you in the side of the head? Those kinds of components, when armor is made, you have to think a bout where does everything go when it's moved this way or that way. I've seen some pretty fantastical pieces of real armor and go 'how did they move that?' but I've also seen people with poorly designed armor hurt themselves."
Craig's take: "The biggest thing to learn from this is that guys designed this game. Anytime you are reducing the amount of protective surface in armor, you're making that choice because you need the mobility. This kind of thing, there's nothing like it in any historical realm other than berserker vikings who are running around naked to fight because they're hopped up on hallucinogenic berries."
In Fortnite the skin can cost a lot of money, and fans will really appreciate the fact that the game’s “Volcanic Ash-sassin” Pack is on Thursday. The Epic Games Store is updated every week with free games and other free content, and it seems that Fortnite fans can take part in the game this week. @ShiinaBR revealed the free skin, although there were no more details. If they want to claim the skin, people will likely have to download the Epic Games Store launcher in their own homes, but it isn’t entirely clear at this time.
"You look at some of the very first armor attempts are animal parts put onto human beings. About two years ago they found some reindeer ribs in Siberia that had been etched, and had holes drilled in them so they could be laced together as a chestplate. That's probably very early, pre-metal age armor."
Craig's take: "In the conditions they'd be fighting in, if they're down in the Southwest, having lighter materials that don't heat up in the sun would be good. Metal armor gets very hot in the sun. The Romans took over most of their known world with skirts on, so it's not anything to sneeze at. Having elements on their chest, metal plates, is also, many cultures did that. It looks like he's using hubcaps to get that Disney look. You see something really similar in some of the ancient early attempts at armor, whether it was bronze or iron, where you have these circular plates on your chest. It survived in the Persian areas of the middle east much later, even."
You’d think that being one of the most powerful figures in Warcraft lore would give you a certain self-confidence. Apparently not. Arthas here is a guy who just doesn’t know when to give up. Skulls! Skulls everywhere! Skulls and spikes and frosty decorations on every square inch of his armour, as if anyone’s going to see him coming and be all “I’m thinking… Illidan?" It’s particularly unfortunate that as tough as he was back in 2008, 10 years later all that armour can barely soak up a /slap emote. Can’t be comfortable sitting on the Frozen Throne in it either.
Embrace your strange control schemes, PC gamers. If you're young, try not to totally mangle your hand using the default keybindings for Fortnite. It's okay to rebind. And if you see someone out there using their pinky on A, ease them into the wider world of WASDing gently.
