I made all my skins with photoshop, where it's pretty easy because TIFF saves information about "transparency" diffrent to many other formats that just fill in white once you save the file...
on photoshop you can just simply erase the area and save as TIFF... (transparency is shown with the grey/white sqares in the background layer)

Well, as of 1.4, you could make invisibility potions. Just punch the victim to death if you want to be totally invisible or have a floating diamond sword :). I believe that mobs cannot see you unless you provoke them first, and that the most potent invisibility potion has a duration of six minutes.
