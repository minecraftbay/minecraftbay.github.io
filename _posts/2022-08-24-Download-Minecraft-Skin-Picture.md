## Download minecraft skin pictures.

In order to continue, youâ€™ll need to download the Minecraft skin template online. This template is a very small image having a size of just 64 x 64 pixels, which means that most images added onto it will be significantly larger, and the images that work the best with this type of template is a square image that allows for easy downscaling.

The first step is to select the item in the image you want to be your new Minecraft skin. The desired picture should be a high-resolution image that offers the ability to see the item that you wish to be your new Minecraft skin. Another thing to consider when choosing an image is if the image is a square resolution; itâ€™ll work best with a system like this.

The most popular skin editors are the Nova Skin editor and the MinecraftSkins skin editor. In the MinecraftSkin editor, below the color wheel and the navigator, there is a button that allows you to upload files from your computer. After pressing this button, you can then upload your edited PNG skin file and take a quick peek at what your skin will look like in-game.
