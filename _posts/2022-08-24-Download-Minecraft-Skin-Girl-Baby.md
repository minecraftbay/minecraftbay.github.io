Custom Minecraft skins are very desirable, and nearly everyone that plays Multiplayer regularly has one. We've already made a guide on how to make, edit and change your Minecraft skin, and that process is very similar to this guide. With that being said, let's see how you can put an image onto a Minecraft skin.
The most popular skin editors are the Nova Skin editor and the MinecraftSkins skin editor. In the MinecraftSkin editor, below the color wheel and the navigator, there is a button that allows you to upload files from your computer. After pressing this button, you can then upload your edited PNG skin file and take a quick peek at what your skin will look like in-game.
All in all, we hope today's guide at least showed you where to start when it comes to putting a custom image on a skin. Being able to find skins and download them is one thing, but creating your own custom skin is more satisfying. If you're interested in other articles similar to this, we've also got guides on how to upload pictures into Minecraft, and where you can download skins.

The two default skins in Minecraft are called Steve and Alex. They are simple skins and not too much of a deal, but many players want to have a skin that's more personalized. Players have created a variety interesting and creative skins, and you can apply them to your player.

To do this, users can import and then resize the image to fit over the skin with ease. In addition to resizing, users can reconfigure the image to be better suited to work as a Minecraft skin. This is done by editing the image to fit into the required 64 x 64 pixel size of all Minecraft skins.
Buying custom skins may be easier, and this is due to the work being completed by someone else, saving you the trouble and hassle. The lower cost and quick delivery make this a perfect choice for someone that doesnâ€™t have hours to spend creating perfect Minecraft skins.
