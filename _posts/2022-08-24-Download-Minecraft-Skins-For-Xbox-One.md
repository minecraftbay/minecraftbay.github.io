## Download minecraft skins for xbox one.

Once the download is done, press the button to bring the search bar pack up and search for a Minecraft skin website. This example article will be using Skindex. Once on the skin website, players should search for the skin they want to use and select it. This should give players the option to download the skin.

Ensure all games and apps are closed and launch a new instance of Minecraft. After seeing the “Loading Resource Packs” message, players need to hit the guide button, navigate to the right, and hit the “Sign Out” button. This will launch a window to choose a profile and select the main profile for the skin.
The last step is to move the new skin pack into Minecraft’s game files. Hover over the skinpack, hit the button with the three lines, and select cut. Then, hit the star icon on the left, and select “Local” from the list. Once navigated to the local folder, find and enter the “Packages” folder.
Once in the Minecraft folder, there should be a folder named LocalState that players should enter, enter the games, and then com.mojang folders. This is where Minecraft's files are. There should be a “skin_packs” folder that the custom skinpack can be pasted into. Players can do it manually using the name mentioned if this folder does not exist.
Once the zip file is deleted, players should hover over the skin they want to use in Minecraft and hit that same button with the lines. They should select cut from the list of options. Players should then navigate into the skinpack. One of these skins will be replaced by a custom skin.

One of the first results should be the skinpack searched for and hosted on mcpedl.com. Click the link and download the skinpack from the website. Use the download link supplied on the page. The only thing of note is to make sure that when saving the skinpack, edit the name, remove the .skinpack from the end, and replace it with .zip.
Once this is done, players should use the back arrow to return to the downloads folder. Players should hover over the skin pack containing the custom skin, press the button with the three lines and select the compress option. This will convert it back into a zip file. Once the compression is done, use the button with the three lines to rename the zip file, remove the .zip and replace it with .skinpack.
Once the player has downloaded the skin or skins they want, they should close out of the Internet Browser. They should then reopen the FullTrust version of the Adv File Explorer app. Once in the app, players must click the three vertical boxes below the star icon on the left and select downloads from the list shown.
Once in the downloads folder, players should see the skin or skins they downloaded and the skinpack ZIP file. Players should then hover over the skinpack zip file and hit the button on their controller with the three lines. This should bring up an options menu where players can select to extract. Once the content is successfully extracted, the zip file can be safely deleted.

One feature that makes Minecraft Minecraft is the ability to use custom skins for a more personalized experience. Java players can download any skin image from the internet and upload it to their account on Minecraft.net, but Bedrock players do not have the same luxury.
