## If you want to change the look of your minecraft character, you can download skins.

The easiest way to customize your Minecraft skin is downloading them. You can download skins for different occasions, characters and purposes. When you find the right skin on Planet Minecraft, you'll see options for changing your skin or downloading the image file to import in your game. If you're using Java Edition, you can simply change your skin and it will automatically upload it to your minecraft.net account.
