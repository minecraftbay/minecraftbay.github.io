Y'all people can try it, but I'm not using it. It's the new update on Minecraft, I honestly thought this app would work! But no! When I try putting on the mob skin, my screen went black. Twice, I had to restart my phone. I rather do something else to become a mob than use this app. This is fake, DON'T DOWNLOAD!!! IF YOU WANT YOUR PHONE TO CRASH, BE MY GUEST!
Six days ago we released the Mob Skin update and the community has already posted over 800 mob skins! You've proven once again that creativity has no bounds. We're laughing, crying, hurling, face palming and dying to get these mobs into our game where they can live a long or maybe a very short life!
Found it: The correct directory name is "textures\entity\creeper" not "Textures\Entities\creeper" -- capitalization probably doesn't matter (since it's Windows) but "entity" vs "entities" definitely matters. All lowercase is how the official add-on packs are done.

## Select a minecraft mob skin from the skin pack.

I can't make this work,I put the .zip file into the resourcepack folder and load it in game but it wouldn't change the mob's skin. How should I fix this?(And I download many different skins for different mobs from many different authors and none of those work so I don't think it's the zip's problem)
https://www.planetminecraft.com/mob-skin/northrop-b-2-bomber/I downloaded a lot so there one of them.I don't think you'll want to try all of them one by one.(And I also don't have them all bookmarked so need to take some time to search for them)Also thank you so much for helping me!And if you really want to check all of them please tell me.
A custom skin is a way to personalize the player model and can be done either by using a variety of community-made skin editors, or by editing the steve.png or alex.png file manually with an image editor like Photoshop, GIMP, Paint.net or similar image editors. The steve.png file can be downloaded here and the alex.png file here. When editing the steve.png or alex.png file manually, be sure to keep the original image dimensions and make the background of the skin (the unused pixels) completely transparent. Otherwise, Minecraft may fail to recognize the skin as intended.
Only players who have purchased Minecraft can change their character's skin. This is done on the profile page or in the Minecraft Launcher by uploading a valid .png texture that is 64×64 pixels, or a legacy texture that is 64×32 pixels, which then replaces the default skin.
Today, we've released the missing link to get these custom mob skins into your Minecraft game, Downloadable Mini Mob Packs! We support 60+ mobs in PMCSkin3D but many of them have multiple variations in the game. The cat mob has 7 variations in Java Edition and 11 variations in the Bedrock Edition alone. Ultimately, we currently support exporting mob skins into 286 downloadable variations!
New skin pack in order to add your game variety and unique. It gives you opportunity to transform your skin into Iron golem, or any other available mob in MCPE. The best skin will be as a mob, especially in multyplayer game. As soon as you will be active in world they will see your name over you.
After making a custom skin, either by using a skin editor or by editing the steve.png file directly, one still needs to upload the .png file at the Skin section of the Profile page on Minecraft.net (found here) before the skin is applied. Other players in multiplayer can also see this skin. Note that players cannot see the custom skin if they are not logged in or when playing offline.
Since Pocket Edition v0.11.0 alpha, players can choose one of the two default skins either Steve or Alex, and can apply their own custom skin. (Uses the same format as the Java edition). The player must select a valid skin image from their photo library, and must choose between the two main models. Players can also spend Minecraft Coins to buy skin packs. The Legacy Skin Pack was also implemented in Bedrock Edition, but the player has to sign in to Xbox Live to access all the skins. It also includes five anonymous skins. Players can also make their own skin packs, which must include a manifest.json file, a skins.json file, and all the desired skins. An additional .lang file can be added inside a folder labeled texts to display the skin names, but the game can register the skins without it.
