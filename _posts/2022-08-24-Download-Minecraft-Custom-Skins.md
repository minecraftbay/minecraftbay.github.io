## Download minecraft custom skins.

There can be two ways to edit and make your own custom Minecraft skins. First, you can use the default skin as a model and edit it in any photo editing software like Photoshop. It will give you more customization options and allow you to add photos over it as well. Just make sure to save it as transparent PNG in the same resolution and dimensions as the base skin.

We are starting from the tool you just witnessed. Skindex is one of the most popular community websites to download Minecraft skins. You can expect almost every popular Minecraft skin to be available here, including those inspired by official marketplace skins.

While referring to Minecraft skins, we will focus on the skin packs for our protagonist instead of the entities or mobs in the game. That means skins in Minecraft usually refer to the appearance of the main character, which you can customize in unlimited ways. To change other characters’ skins, you will need something called Minecraft resource or texture packs, and you can check out some of the best ones from the linked article. For now, make sure you have a working version of Minecraft, and let’s get started by finding a good skin for your character.
3. Now, you can also add images or symbols to your skins. Dragging and dropping images work on almost all modern image editors, so do that if you wish to add more textures to your Minecraft skin. You have to resize the imported images so that they don’t mess up the dimensions of the main file. Alternatively, you can use some of the best Minecraft mods to get high-quality skins in the game.
Click the download button to save your skin. Make sure you save the skin to your photo library to make it later accessible in Minecraft. To do so, tap the image and hold until a menu appears and select Save Image. Open Minecraft and press the Store button. Then press the Custom Skin model. Press the Choose New Skin button. You now have the option of applying your skin to a Steve (Male) or Alex (Female) model. Now press the Confirm button to confirm this is the skin and model that will be used for your player from now on.
Once you are done creating your custom skin, you can click the “Download” button on the bottom right to get the skin as a PNG file. Alternatively, you can even upload it on Skindex for people to enjoy using the button to the left of the “Download” button.
