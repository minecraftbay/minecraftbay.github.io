Before you can change your skin, you'll first need to have a new skin to change to. The developers of Minecraft offer a few custom skins for free, usually created in honor of special events. You can also check out websites like The Skindex, which host user-created skins that you can download and use yourself.
There can be two ways to edit and make your own custom Minecraft skins. First, you can use the default skin as a model and edit it in any photo editing software like Photoshop. It will give you more customization options and allow you to add photos over it as well. Just make sure to save it as transparent PNG in the same resolution and dimensions as the base skin.
3. Once you are done editing the skin, you can select the Model as Classic or Slim and click on the “Download” button. You can apply it to your character in the same manner as any other downloaded skin. Alternatively, you can also upload your skin to Skindex by clicking on the “Upload to Skindex” button. It’ll let you share your creation with other Minecraft players that use this website.
While referring to Minecraft skins, we will focus on the skin packs for our protagonist instead of the entities or mobs in the game. That means skins in Minecraft usually refer to the appearance of the main character, which you can customize in unlimited ways. To change other characters’ skins, you will need something called Minecraft resource or texture packs, and you can check out some of the best ones from the linked article. For now, make sure you have a working version of Minecraft, and let’s get started by finding a good skin for your character.

Even when you can use the same skin on any of your Minecraft versions, you will have to follow different procedures to get it installed on each of them. You can suspect different programming languages as the reason to blame, as we discussed in our Minecraft Java vs Bedrock comparison.
3. Now, the launcher will ask you to load your custom skin. Here, click on the “Browse”button to select your download PNG skin file. You can use the player model as classic or slim. Once your skin is selected, you can click the “Save & Use” button to apply it immediately.
Android application HD Skins for Minecraft PE (128x128) developed by Crone is listed under category Entertainment7. The current version is 2.0.5, released on 18/03/2022 . According to Google Play HD Skins for Minecraft PE (128x128) achieved more than 5 million installs. HD Skins for Minecraft PE (128x128) currently has 53 thousand ratings with average rating value of 4.5
2. Now, you will see an option called “Skin” on the left menu, which on clicking will lead you to the skin uploading section. Here, you can select your model version as Slim or Classic and upload any downloaded skin. The slim model only has the character with slimmer arms and no other significant difference.
Technically, you can use the same PNG skin file in Bedrock or Java editions. But since Bedrock has extra geometrical layers to their skins, you might not see the expected results when you inter-use the skins. Though, using the same skins on different game editions won’t cause any serious problems.
