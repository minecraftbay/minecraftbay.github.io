## Download minecraft skin guy for free.

So I was looking for games that you could MAKE or EDIT Minecraft skins and I found this game! When I first got it i was suprised that I accidentally got a BOY Minecraft skin game. I was just like, Oh well I’ll work with what I’ve got. So when I opened the game I got the shocking surprise that you had to PAY for skins! Well a few minutes later I found that I at least had two skins. So I got on then and guess what. To my shocking surprise, YOU CANT EDIT THE SKINS. You can only put them on or put them in three stupid poses. Definitely the worst app ive ever gotten. A little work of advice to people who WANT to make skin, go on the internet and type in ‘Online make your own Minecraft skin’ and I checked and almost all of them work fine! So yeah. Not my best app.
