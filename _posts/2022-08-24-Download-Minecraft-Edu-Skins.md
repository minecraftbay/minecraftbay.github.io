## Download minecraft edu skins.

Minecraft Education Edition requires you to create a MCPACK file which contains all the files required for your custom Minecraft skin. The PNG image file and a couple of JSON files. Matt’s work means you only need to have the PNG image and his online tool will create the JSON files and package those with your image into the MCPACK file required by Minecraft.

Download the MCPACK file, then double-click it to open in Minecraft Education Edition. If you have multiple versions of Minecraft installed on your device it would be easier to first open Minecraft Education Edition, then choose to Import the MCPACK file you downloaded.

The skin(s) will then show up in the Minecraft Education Edition and can be used as any other skin would normally show up. If it doesn't, then Minecraft likely needs to be quit and the file opened again. This process can be repeated as many times as players want to with new skins from any source.

Minecraft is a game of almost unlimited possibility with gamers creating incredibly detailed movie recreations, villages and more, but that doesn’t really extend to your default character skin.

3. In the new section that opens up, click on the “browse” option and select the PNG file of your skin. Then you can name the skin under the “name” tab. As for the player model, selecting the “slim” option can get you slightly skinnier player arms. Finally, click on the “save” or “save & use” option to store and equip the skin.
