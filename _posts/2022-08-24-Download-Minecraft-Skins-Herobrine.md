Milsom's, Herobrine is back and you're done nothing about it. You're putting Minecraft at risk and if nothing is done is 3 days I'm sorry but well have to send someone else for the rewards. Which will be amazing goods worth lots of money. You're failing us. You are not worthy unless you act now.
Firstly, you'll need to download and install the Herobrine mod from burnner_ on the Minecraft Forum here. It's worth noting that there's no confirmation that you'll even see him in Minecraft once you install this. In addition to this, when you do see him he will disappear immediately.

Hi green dev team, i am a user of one of your application named skins for minecraft. Well, as added in the new update, we can edit our favourite skins. But am very sorry to say that it really doesn't works. It shows that the skin is saved in gallery, but still there is nothing. So i will ask you and the dev team to make this problem better. This application is very fine and also there are a great variety of skins are available. And so i liked your app. So please fix it, good luck :)

Minecraft, the Minecraft trademark, and Minecraft assets are the property of Mojang AB or its respected owner. All rights reserved. According to http://account.mojang.com/documents/brand_guidelines
Since Pocket Edition v0.11.0 alpha, players can choose one of the two default skins either Steve or Alex, and can apply their own custom skin. (Uses the same format as the Java edition). The player must select a valid skin image from their photo library, and must choose between the two main models. Players can also spend Minecraft Coins to buy skin packs. The Legacy Skin Pack was also implemented in Bedrock Edition, but the player has to sign in to Xbox Live to access all the skins. It also includes five anonymous skins. Players can also make their own skin packs, which must include a manifest.json file, a skins.json file, and all the desired skins. An additional .lang file can be added inside a folder labeled texts to display the skin names, but the game can register the skins without it.
The character creator is a feature in Bedrock Edition (and was in Minecraft Earth until discontinuation) that lets players customize their skins with free and paid-for cosmetic items. It can be accessed by selecting the character profile button on the main menu. It can also be used to equip capes. Many clothing items cost Minecoins (Tokens on PlayStation 4), or can be earned by completing certain achievements.
Only players who have purchased Minecraft can change their character's skin. This is done on the profile page or in the Minecraft Launcher by uploading a valid .png texture that is 64×64 pixels, or a legacy texture that is 64×32 pixels, which then replaces the default skin.

## Herobrine is a minecraft monster that is sometimes confused with minecraft's creator, jeb.

Herobrine is a rumored Hostile Mob found in Minecraft. He is the center of endless speculation and Creepypasta, producing explanations of his origins such as a ghost, Notch's dead brother, revenge carried out by a fired Mojang employee, and a slew of others.
🌟👻 One of the most secret mysteries of Minecraft is Herobrine, a character with white empty eyes, who nicknamed him the dead miner or the miner's ghost. Do you want to change your old skin to a cool skin with white eyes and find out who this mysterious Herobrine is?
While many players claim to have seen this mysterious pseudo-player (who is apparently able to manipulate the world, just like Steve), no concrete evidence of Herobrine has been produced to date (no, guys, YouTube videos don't exactly prove he's out there.)
About a month passed until I heard from my informant again. Some of the people who had encountered the mystery man had looked into the name Herobrine and found that name to be frequently used by a Swedish gamer. After some further information gathering, it was revealed to be the brother of Notch, the game's developer. I personally emailed Notch, and asked him if he had a brother. It took him a while, but he emailed me back a very short message:
" Herobrine is simply a figment of the user's imagination. All users the user talked to, including Notch's email reply, could simply be the creation of the player's mind. This would also explain Notch's rejection of the canon, as showing the story is all in the user's head."
It wasn't a cow though. Looking back at me was another character with the default skin, but his eyes were empty. I saw no name pop up, and I double-checked to make sure I wasn't in multiplayer mode. He didn't stay long, he looked at me and quickly ran into the fog. I pursued out of curiosity, but he was gone,
I had recently spawned a new world in single-player Minecraft. Everything was normal at first as I began chopping down trees and crafting a workbench. I noticed something move amongst the dense fog (I have a very slow computer so I have to play with a tiny render distance). I thought it was a cow, so I pursued it, hoping to grab some hides for armor.
I continued on with the game, not sure what to think. As I expanded to world I saw things that seemed out of place for the random map generator to make; 2x2 tunnels in the rocks, small perfect pyramids made of sand in the ocean, and groves of trees with all their leaves cut off. I would constantly think I saw the other "player" in the deep fog, but I never got a better look at him. I tried increasing my render distance to far whenever I thought I saw him, but to no avail.
