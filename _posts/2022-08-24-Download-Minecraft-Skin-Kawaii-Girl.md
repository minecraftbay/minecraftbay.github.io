## This downloadable minecraft skin features a kawaii girl character.

I don't know how to get the skin I selected. When I download the skin it didn't work for me and when I tried the install button beside the download button it was saying that you have to install Minecraft I can't install Minecraft and these skins are not for Kawaiiworld.
