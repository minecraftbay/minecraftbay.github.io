Other than the unique texture, you can even notice the Creeper’s mouth on it. If you want to see how it looks next to an actual Creeper, you can get it right away.
The current Minecraft roster doesn’t offer a lot in terms of diversity for Zombie mobs. This skin tackles that by providing us with a female zombie.

Its aesthetic fits well with the existing in-game design.
