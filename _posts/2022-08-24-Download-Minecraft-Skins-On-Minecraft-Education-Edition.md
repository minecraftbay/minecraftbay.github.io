## Learn how to download minecraft skins on minecraft education edition.

Minecraft Education Edition requires you to create a MCPACK file which contains all the files required for your custom Minecraft skin. The PNG image file and a couple of JSON files. Matt’s work means you only need to have the PNG image and his online tool will create the JSON files and package those with your image into the MCPACK file required by Minecraft.

Download the MCPACK file, then double-click it to open in Minecraft Education Edition. If you have multiple versions of Minecraft installed on your device it would be easier to first open Minecraft Education Edition, then choose to Import the MCPACK file you downloaded.

Minecraft is a game of almost unlimited possibility with gamers creating incredibly detailed movie recreations, villages and more, but that doesn’t really extend to your default character skin. In fact, we think that the default skins in Minecraft leave much to be desired, but without a built-in skin editor, how can you change the skin of your character?

How can students share their projects? Students can only share within their classroom. Once they publish a project, it appears in the Class Showcase and be seen by other students in that classroom. To allow class sharing, you’ll need to set up a classroom and create accounts for your students, then make sure they’re logged in as they code.
Where are students’ projects saved on Tynker? If students are logged in to Tynker accounts, their projects will be share to their accounts, allowing them to access these projects every time they log in to Tynker in their “My Projects” tab. If students are not logged in, their projects will be linked to the computer they’re using.

## Download skins for minecraft education edition.

Yes, you can have custom skins in Minecraft Education Edition, but you will need to do a bit of work to get them. First, you will need to find a skin that you like and that follows the rules of your school. Next, you will need to know how to safely get the skin into the game without harming the files that make Minecraft run.
The skin(s) will then show up in the Minecraft Education Edition and can be used as any other skin would normally show up. If it doesn't, then Minecraft likely needs to be quit and the file opened again. This process can be repeated as many times as players want to with new skins from any source.
Atharv Dhiman thank you for your thoughts, we have added them here along with the thread on custom skins. Please read the top of the thread for our latest update on custom skins - we actively share our thoughts with developers and your voice matters!2 hours agoI am playing Minecraft Education Edition for 1 year and I have been playing Minecraft Java Edition for 6 months . I have noticed that there are custom skins in java but not in education . I have played the trial for bedrock and we can add custom skins in it . education edition's layout is based on the bedrock edition . so please give us an option to add custom skins and mods . I have also noticed that education edition is 2 step behind java and bedrock edition in updates . Can you add an option to change the version of education and please update the version of education as cave update is gonna come and my friends who don't have java or bedrock are crying because they don't have the nether update in education . please add the nether update in education . I hope you see my request and add the following things I said . We would be pleased if you update our version of Minecraft and add custom skinsthe education edition is 1 step behind java and bedrock edition . I mistakenly said 2 step behind
There are no boundaries when it comes to how creative Minecraft players can be. In fact, Mojang saw so much potential from the world of Minecraft that they made Minecraft Education Edition to help out teachers. If you are playing Education Edition, but have grown tired of the skins, then you are probably wondering if and how you can change them.
Response: Minecraft: Education Edition is currently not compatible with mods. All worlds that have been approved for use with Minecraft: Education Edition can be found on our lessons page and in the Library in-game. However, it is possible to create custom resource packs for the game to change many aspects of the game. Take a look at this video from one of our amazing mentors to learn more about using resource packs with Minecraft: Education Edition: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqFw0pf3Tkw&t=5s
Yeah sure I bet that you're not even the real person and this is just an autoreply because it's been 2 YEARS and there are still none of your promised features. Don't just say you'll do something and then not care enough to actually do it. So many students want custom skins and features and you say that you're going to add them, but you're too lazy to actually do it. I don't know if you've ever played Java minecraft, but it's infinitly better than education edition already so the LEAST you could do is hear us out and fufill your promises.
Skins are a way for students to be creative. It would be awesome if there were some way to customize the skins so each one was a little different. Kind of like the character creation bits at the beginning of a lot of the role playing games the kids play so much.
This is in an effort to keep the education environment safe for all. Our development team is actively researching more skins to include. We'd love to hear your constructive thoughts below. Why are you interested in this feature, and what is the impact on your current teaching situation?
