Playstation has its own version of Minecraft which was converted to the Bedrock version of Minecraft. Originally Xbox, Mobile, and Playstation versions all were separate from each other, but after Microsoft bought Mojang studios, those other versions were merged together into the Bedrock version. This merger excluded the Playstation version, which makes sense as Microsoft is trying to garner much more interest in their console, the Xbox One.This version of Minecraft also handles skins different from the previous two different versions. The Playstation version of Minecraft uses the PlayStation marketplace to purchase the skin packs that allow users to change your Minecraft skin easily.One prime example of this is Minecraft Skin Pack 1 and is currently priced at $2.99.Which consists of just waiting until the server refreshes or updates your client.There are a variety of different methods to try and fix this issue including:

It’s impossible. It has been requested repeatedly by fans, but Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, the version currently available on consoles, still does not allow you to make custom skins or upload them legally. In Minecraft, you can customize everything else as well.
