Why i could not move more than #466? Then i just want to create my own minecraft skin but this app is just a trash, because it's just using other parts of minecraft skins to make a new one, and it's outdated. Not recomended to everyone to download it. THIS JUST A TRASH AND a WASTE OF TIME
I recently downloaded this app, and I love the features and content it has to offer! My only issue is that I cannot edit the inside of the arms, body, or legs. When revamping a skin, it is not attractive to have the old skin visible when walking/playing the game. I do not think this would be a difficult fix and look forward to future updates!
