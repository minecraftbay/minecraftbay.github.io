You can also make an iron golem by making four iron blocks, which comes out to thirty-six iron ingots. Once you have the four iron blocks, you’ll need to place them in a T shape with one up and three across. After that, get a carved pumpkin and place it in the middle and the golem will be born. The T shape needed to build an iron golem is shown below.
Iron Golems are NPCs that you'll usually find wandering around friendly villages. They seem peaceful at first, but as soon as they see an enemy, they'll sprint over and punch it into dust. That can include you, too; if you attack an Iron Golem or hurt a villager near it, it'll go berserk.
Iron Golems are a unique neutral mob in Minecraft, they can be found all throughout the world in every biome. Iron Golem are known to protect players and villagers if harmed.

Iron Golems are a great way to protect villagers and your base. You’ll often find them wandering around and patrolling villages. They’re known to attack all hostile mobs as soon as they see them.

This will let your Iron Golem roam the grounds and attack enemies, but they won't wander away. Just make sure that your Golem doesn't have any blocks to hop on and jump over the fence.
Quick tip: You can also make a Snow Golem — a living snowman — by stacking a carved pumpkin, jack o'lantern, or (in Bedrock Edition only) pumpkin on top of two snow blocks. Snow Golems will throw snowballs at nearby enemies and take damage from warm weather and rain.
