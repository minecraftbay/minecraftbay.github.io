The best thing about playing Minecraft is that you can change the skins of the game character multiple times. So after downloading the skin, all you need to do is create or edit the same skin on the Minecraft website, and then download the skin for your PC and upload it to the game.
Unless you buy them from the official marketplace, all the Minecraft skins available online are free. Though, you can find some paid third-party skin apps on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. But we don’t suggest using them or spending money on them.
Bonus: Skinpack Creator for Minecraft Education Edition: Create a custom skin using one of the tools above. Then fill out the name for your skin, name for the skin pack, and a version number then upload your custom skin image file as a ".png". Then download it and you can open it in Minecraft.
If you want to access the latest content, skins available on Minecraft, make sure to update the game from the official website or wait for the update to automatically bring changes to the game on your PC. Windows 10 users have to use Microsoft Store to update Minecraft.
