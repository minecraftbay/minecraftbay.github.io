## Find minecraft skins by username.

Skins are typically stored in your .minecraft folder. There is a skins folder, which contains all cached skins in multiple folders. These are .png files, however they are not named as such; you have to rename them. You also don't get to see the usernames, just a generated number.

Before you can change your skin, you'll first need to have a new skin to change to. The developers of Minecraft offer a few custom skins for free, usually created in honor of special events. You can also check out websites like The Skindex, which host user-created skins that you can download and use yourself.
Changing a Minecraft skin depends on what platform you are using.

For pocket edition/console versions of Minecraft, simply access the wardobe/current skins page through the main menu and change your skin through that.
