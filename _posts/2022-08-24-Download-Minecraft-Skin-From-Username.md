After selecting your desired skin, you can download it which will be stored in your download files on your device but in windows, you have to bear in mind that, the downloading file will store in different locations in your device according to the settings of the browser and for this, you need to select a location where your skin will be downloaded.
Here the players face another problem – a wide range of different styles and skins, an embarrassment of riches. One way to solve the problem is to choose clothes for the character, similar to ones of another Minecraft user. It can be a skin of a famous LP-reviewer or just interesting original work.
Of course you can just approach the man in the game and ask to email or share a copy of his or her stylish look. However, there is an easier method to access such clothes. It is easy to download any skin you like from the site in the appropriate category by entering the character name, for whom it is intended, in the search, that is, the nickname of the player. Even if you do not have a specific look in mind, you can always choose any Minecraft skin by nickname among those that are presented on the website in this category.

Minecraft is an international game for guys and girls. Everyone finds in it what he likes. The same applies to the individual look of the character. The best way to find an alternative skin for your beauty with a pickaxe and a sword is to visit the category of skins by nicknames.
The first and foremost and also the very important thing is – you must have an account in Microsoft. For PC, you need to have to log in with the same Microsoft account on the Microsoft store otherwise you won’t be able to download the Minecraft launcher.
If any skin is copied, which you have to do is – go to the censurable skin page and there will be a flag under the thumbs down icon. From the flag icon, choose the option named ” copied skin ” and also paste the original skin link and submit your report which will take 72 hours at least to take action.
