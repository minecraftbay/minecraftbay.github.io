Minecraft is a game of almost unlimited possibility with gamers creating incredibly detailed movie recreations, villages and more, but that doesn’t really extend to your default character skin. In fact, we think that the default skins in Minecraft leave much to be desired, but without a built-in skin editor, how can you change the skin of your character?

## Minecraft skins let you show your personality.

While referring to Minecraft skins, we will focus on the skin packs for our protagonist instead of the entities or mobs in the game. That means skins in Minecraft usually refer to the appearance of the main character, which you can customize in unlimited ways. To change other characters’ skins, you will need something called Minecraft resource or texture packs, and you can check out some of the best ones from the linked article. For now, make sure you have a working version of Minecraft, and let’s get started by finding a good skin for your character.
There can be two ways to edit and make your own custom Minecraft skins. First, you can use the default skin as a model and edit it in any photo editing software like Photoshop. It will give you more customization options and allow you to add photos over it as well. Just make sure to save it as transparent PNG in the same resolution and dimensions as the base skin.
1. To get started, go to the Minecraft Skindex homepage and click on any of the skins you like. We will be using the Skeleton Gamer skin for this demonstration. You can even try using the search option to look for a specific character or theme. Also, you can check our curated lists of the coolest Minecraft skins and the best Minecraft girl skins via the linked articles.

3. Once you are done editing the skin, you can select the Model as Classic or Slim and click on the “Download” button. You can apply it to your character in the same manner as any other downloaded skin. Alternatively, you can also upload your skin to Skindex by clicking on the “Upload to Skindex” button. It’ll let you share your creation with other Minecraft players that use this website.
Once they've created or selected their skin, they will need to get it onto their Windows 10 device. Every Minecraft skin website that lets users create or choose a skin should have the option to Download or Save that skin. When prompted to save the file, they can select Save.
3. Now, the launcher will ask you to load your custom skin. Here, click on the “Browse”button to select your download PNG skin file. You can use the player model as classic or slim. Once your skin is selected, you can click the “Save & Use” button to apply it immediately.
Even when you can use the same skin on any of your Minecraft versions, you will have to follow different procedures to get it installed on each of them. You can suspect different programming languages as the reason to blame, as we discussed in our Minecraft Java vs Bedrock comparison.
