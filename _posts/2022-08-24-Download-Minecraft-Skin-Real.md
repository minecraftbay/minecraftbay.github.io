Before you can change your skin, you'll first need to have a new skin to change to. The developers of Minecraft offer a few custom skins for free, usually created in honor of special events. You can also check out websites like The Skindex, which host user-created skins that you can download and use yourself.
You can download Minecraft skins for Android mobile phone as well. All you have to do is pay Rs 80 to download the official Minecraft app called Minecraft: Skin Studio from Google Play Store. The app lets you create a new Minecraft skin and also allows users to browse for new skins, upload the skins and design new Minecraft skins.
The easiest way to customize your Minecraft skin is downloading them. You can download skins for different occasions, characters and purposes. When you find the right skin on Planet Minecraft, you'll see options for changing your skin or downloading the image file to import in your game. If you're using Java Edition, you can simply change your skin and it will automatically upload it to your minecraft.net account. If you're using Windows 10 Bedrock Edition, download the skin file, open Minecraft and import the file from your skin settings. Consider leaving some kind feedback on the skin creators content!

Once you've created or selected your skin, you'll need to get it onto your Windows 10 device. Every Minecraft skin website that lets you create or choose a skin should have the option to Download or Save your skin. When prompted to save the file, select Save.
You will then be taken to the activated Minecraft Skins Chooser. The place allows you to preview and select from a pretty wide variety of skins. Many of them are free, yet there are still some that need to be purchased with Minecraft Coins. The skins for purchase only are marked with an icon of a white lock.
Minecraft is compatible with iOS devices also. And you can download skins for the mobile version of Minecraft as well. All you to do is pay Rs 349 to download the app from Apple App Store. You can use this app on devices running iOS 8 or later version.
2. Scroll through the available characters and click Edit Character under one of your existing models, or select one of the blank slots and then click Create Character. If you're making a new character, it doesn't matter whether you pick Character or Classic Skin in the pop-up that appears.
In Survival Mode, you need to have two animals and feed them both their favorite food. Pigs and rabbits like carrots; sheep, cows, and mushrooms like wheat; chickens like any kind of seed. You'll know you've been successful in mating your animals when hearts appear next to them and they collide with each other. Then, a baby version of the animal will appear. Or, in Creative Mode, get a Spawn Egg and simply click on an animal with the egg to produce a baby version of that animal.
