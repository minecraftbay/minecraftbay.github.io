Looking for some cool Minecraft skins? Fashion faux pas are serious business and it is not just a case of following the latest trends or knowing this season’s wardrobe essentials. Instead, it is an ongoing battle to turn up wearing one of these cool MC skins to make all your friends jealous.
For those who want to become a mighty pirate, Guybrush from Monkey Island 2 is one of the best Minecraft skins when it comes to game recreations. The block-based graphics of Minecraft perfectly capture the look and feel of the classic LucasArts adventure game.
Speaking of decent female skins, this Billie Eilish Minecraft skin takes inspiration from the much-memed and genuinely awesome music video for Bad Guy. It’s simple from a distance, but brilliantly detailed up close – take a look at the shading of her blue hair.
While you're unlikely to be vaulting across canyons or climbing the sides of precarious mountain passes, Lara Croft (opens in new tab) seems like an ideal choice for a cool Minecraft skin. You're technically not going to be exploring tombs but if you're planning on spending a bit of time mining underground, who better than an archaeologist to help you find those treasures?

How about Sailor Moon (opens in new tab) for another classic caped anime hero? Her pigtails may be a bit flatter than in the show but hey, that's Minecraft for you. The same creator has also made skins for Sailor Mercury (opens in new tab) and Sailor Mars (opens in new tab).
Knock back a few cans of Duff beer and make sure you have a tray of pink doughnuts at the ready as you can play as the lovable Homer Simpson in Minecraft if you equip this skin! It's not just Homer that's available though as you can get skins for the whole Simpsons family - including baby Maggie.
The toughest superhero around? Quite possibly, but we can say for certain that Wonder Woman – or Diana Prince – is a skin that we would want to wear in Minecraft. Seeing her super suit in Minecraft form really is quite the sight - we adore it. There are actually a few different Wonder Woman skin variations you can choose if you wanted some variety too.
It'll only take a quick search to discover that there are actually loads of Lady Gaga skins in Minecraft for players to choose from, with pretty much all of her famous fashion choices being adapted into the game by loyal fans from around the globe. We'd expect no less, to be honest with you!

## Choose the best minecraft skin for you.

If you find yourself needing to cover up your fabulous skin with armour, it might as well be the best in the game – here’s how to get netherite in Minecraft. Also, if you’re looking for more from Mojang’s masterwork in terms of gameplay, these Minecraft servers are a great place to start. That’s in from us though, we’ve got some new blocky skins to try on.
Our list of the best Minecraft has customization options for every mood, and we've even laid out how to use a skin editor where you can take crack at putting your own skins together. Between these options, you can get started on securing that perfect character skin—or crafting a look of your own.
There you go, cool Minecraft skins you can slap onto your blocky self. Obviously you’re not going to beat us in a ‘who wore it better’ competition in the Star Wars category but you can give yourself an extra chance and make your game look much better with Minecraft shaders and Minecraft texture packs.
Next up is just about the creepiest thing we have ever seen. Yes, you can get a Pennywise skin and walk about the world of Minecraft making everyone else uncomfortable. But if you do decide that this is the skin for you, may we suggest reevaluating your life choices?
To equip a new Minecraft skin, click on the coathanger icon then choose the blank skin. You’re then looking for a Choose New Skin button, which will open up your file folder. You can then choose your skin from where you've saved it in the folder and away you go.
A fitting skin to have for a game like Minecraft that involves lots of building, Bob is another that you can get in the game. Sadly, he doesn't just take over all the building for you and he offers no extra skills, but if you are going to go around building things then you may as well do it while looking like Bob the Builder!
Stardew Valley is another pixelated game about farming and adventures, so it's no surprise at all to see some Stardew character skins make their way to Minecraft. If you're looking for another cute girl skin, Abigail is a great choice. Or maybe try on Leah instead. Both should feel right at home in the nearest village.
There’s no point messing around in the amazing worlds created by the best minds if you’re not looking just as special. If you’re playing on the Bedrock Edition of Minecraft, the new character creator lets you customise your character model with numerous free and premium Minecraft skins, so you can roam around the coolest play areas generated by Minecraft seeds as the pixel version of yourself.
