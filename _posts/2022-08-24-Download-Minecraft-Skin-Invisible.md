## There is a way to make your minecraft skin invisible.

Well, as of 1.4, you could make invisibility potions. Just punch the victim to death if you want to be totally invisible or have a floating diamond sword :). I believe that mobs cannot see you unless you provoke them first, and that the most potent invisibility potion has a duration of six minutes.

You can't make it invisible to my knowledge, however you can say, make it blend in with nighttime, and only go out after dark, or you can make it blend in with stone, and always stay underground. So other than camouflage you really can't be totally invisible, I'm not sure if the whole blackness thing was intentional at first, but after multiplayer was first implemented (Way back in...Creative, or Survival Test, I think), is probably when Notch made it an actual feature.
Minecraft is a game of almost unlimited possibility with gamers creating incredibly detailed movie recreations, villages and more, but that doesnâ€™t really extend to your default character skin. In fact, we think that the default skins in Minecraft leave much to be desired, but without a built-in skin editor, how can you change the skin of your character?
I made all my skins with photoshop, where it's pretty easy because TIFF saves information about "transparency" diffrent to many other formats that just fill in white once you save the file...
on photoshop you can just simply erase the area and save as TIFF... (transparency is shown with the grey/white sqares in the background layer)
