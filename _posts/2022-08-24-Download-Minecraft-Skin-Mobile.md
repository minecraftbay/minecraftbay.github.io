Hour of Code has become a worldwide effort to celebrate computer science, starting with 1-hour coding activities. So today we're going to share some fun Hour of Code Minecraft activities you can complete. We'll guide you step by step through the challenges in the 2019 Minecraft demo world.
Minecraft Education Edition has been a very unique experience for me. At first I thought to myself how is this game going to teach me more about English composition in my college class? We had to play the game in class and that was the first time I’ve ever played Minecraft. Minecraft really opened my mind to see how a game could help me to learn more about english composition and how images, video, and coding, could be used to help communicate English concepts. We played the game and it helped me to realize that by playing the game I was using the game play as a way of communicating with my classmates, and professor simply interacting with the world around me. I also learned about coding as well from the education edition. Coding is a form of language that is used on computers and I learned that coding is a form of language in technology that helps us communicate with the world around us, and it translates into a language that we can see and understand. I would definitely recommend using this to help teach students because it lets students learn from a different perspective, and broadens their minds even further than what they will realize. It also is a plus that’s its fun to play too!
This game is amazing!!! I really recommend it, and it is pretty much that you can build anything you like, and you can either explore around or just fly in the air and build things. I usually like going on Survival Mode, but that is just me. There are diffrent stages to Survival like, Peacefull Mode, Easy Mode Normal Mode, and Hard Mode, and the harder it get's, the more challenges that come. It is a pretty fun game, and i really hope that you will enjoy it as much as i do!
Minecraft education edition is a very good game but, whenever I try to join my sisters game it says unable to connect outdated server, overall Minecraft education edition is an awesome gameCan anybody figure out what’s wrong with mine Minecraft whenever I try to make my sister join my world is says unable to connect but it doesn’t say outdated server it’s probably because she’s using her Computer that the school gave her from 2020 maybe that’s why it says outdated server because there is no online school for my school anymore if you have any ideas on how to get us to join into the same server please help because it was mean a lot also it might be because i use my iPad to play it and she has the district computer so please help it would mean a lot because my sister has been waiting a long time to play with me she has been waiting a couple of hours because she had to find a charger and then she had to wait for it to charge and I don’t wanna leave my sister out where she can’t play but I can thank you for taking your time to read this message I really hope that one of you guys respond and if you have anything similar maybe we can help out each other have a nice day/night/evening

So sometimes like most of the reviews it won’t let me join other people’s world or I can’t join their world, to make it work my friend had to reset her whole iPad, like remove all the data and stuff, but she’s fine with it. And why does the updating go so slow??? I think it’s unfair in my opinion, the other people did pay for normal Minecraft, but I just think it should update a tad bit faster, not as fast as normal Minecraft tho. And I saw a video of a shorts creator and the title was “Is bedrock or Java better?” By camman18, and if camman does see this now I know not to say “canman18” XD. And he said both are good and was like “At least were not in education edition!” I mean I would be upset in this edition as well sorry- So yeah! DEVELOPER RESPONSE PLEASE AHAHAHAHHAHAH-

## Players can customize their character by downloading and installing skins, which are digital graphics that are applied to the player's minecraft character.

But for the creatives who love the design and crafting aspects of Minecraft, don't worry: In reality, your character's cosmetic choices are virtually limitless. For Java edition users, you can find or create a skin, upload it, and enjoy. And Bedrock users have that option and more through its character creator tool.
Minecraft is a game of almost unlimited possibility with gamers creating incredibly detailed movie recreations, villages and more, but that doesn’t really extend to your default character skin. In fact, we think that the default skins in Minecraft leave much to be desired, but without a built-in skin editor, how can you change the skin of your character?
Similar to Java Edition, you can upload a skin you got from the internet, or one you've created yourself for your Bedrock character model. With tons of creative Minecraft users eager to share their skins, you can find almost any cosmetic you can dream up.
Before you can change your skin, you'll first need to have a new skin to change to. The developers of Minecraft offer a few custom skins for free, usually created in honor of special events. You can also check out websites like The Skindex, which host user-created skins that you can download and use yourself.
Click the download button to save your skin. Make sure you save the skin to your photo library to make it later accessible in Minecraft. To do so, tap the image and hold until a menu appears and select Save Image. Open Minecraft and press the Store button. Then press the Custom Skin model. Press the Choose New Skin button. You now have the option of applying your skin to a Steve (Male) or Alex (Female) model. Now press the Confirm button to confirm this is the skin and model that will be used for your player from now on.
If you look closely, Steve’s shirt has at least 3 shades of teal. Most Minecraft skins use multiple shades of the same color to give texture and depth to the characters. So click each square on your character's shirt to change the color. Try adding 3-5 colors you like using the paint brush! To fill in big sections quickly you can use the paint can. If you need ideas for color palettes, check out this helpful tool.
Minecraft Education Edition requires you to create a MCPACK file which contains all the files required for your custom Minecraft skin. The PNG image file and a couple of JSON files. Matt’s work means you only need to have the PNG image and his online tool will create the JSON files and package those with your image into the MCPACK file required by Minecraft.
2. Scroll through the available characters and click Edit Character under one of your existing models, or select one of the blank slots and then click Create Character. If you're making a new character, it doesn't matter whether you pick Character or Classic Skin in the pop-up that appears.
